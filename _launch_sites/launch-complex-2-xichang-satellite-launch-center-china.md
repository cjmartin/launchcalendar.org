Launch Complex 2 (LC-2) is one of the two principal orbital launch pads at the Xichang Satellite Launch Center, located in Sichuan Province, China. Commissioned in the late 1980s to meet China's expanding space ambitions, LC-2 has played a critical role in launching a significant portion of China's communications, navigation, and meteorological satellites using various Long March launch vehicles—including the Long March 2C, 3B, and 3B/E.

Xichang's LC-2 has hosted several high-profile missions and is particularly important for launches intended for geostationary transfer orbits, including the deployment of Beidou navigation satellites. It is operated by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), reflecting its pivotal role in the country’s space program development and international satellite launch services.
