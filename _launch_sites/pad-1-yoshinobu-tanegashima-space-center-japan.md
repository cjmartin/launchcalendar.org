Pad 1, formally part of the Yoshinobu Launch Complex at Tanegashima Space Center, serves as the main site for launching Japan's H-IIA and H3 rockets. Operated by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), this pad began operations in the 1990s and has supported the majority of Japan's major orbital launches, including both scientific and commercial payloads.

Notable for its advanced facilities and scenic coastal setting, Yoshinobu Launch Complex Pad 1 has played a vital role in Japan's space development, supporting missions such as the deployment of satellites, explorations to the Moon and Mars, and contributions to the International Space Station. The pad's reliability and advanced infrastructure make it the cornerstone of Japan's space launch capability.
