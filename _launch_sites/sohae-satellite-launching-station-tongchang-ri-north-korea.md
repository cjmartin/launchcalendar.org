The Sohae Satellite Launching Station, also known as the Tongchang-ri Missile and Space Launch Facility, is North Korea's main satellite launch complex. Situated in Tongchang-ri, Cholsan County, North Pyongan Province, it was constructed in the late 2000s and has since been used for multiple satellite launches, including notable Unha rocket launches that North Korea has claimed were part of peaceful space exploration efforts.

The site is operated by the National Aerospace Development Administration (NADA) and features extensive infrastructure such as a launch pad, control center, and rocket assembly facilities. Despite international controversy and UN sanctions regarding its dual-use nature, Sohae has been central to North Korea's attempts to develop indigenous space capabilities and has played a key role in advancing the country's missile technology.
