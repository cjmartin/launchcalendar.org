Launch Complex 2 (LC-2) at the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center (TSLC) is one of China's principal launch pads for polar orbit and sun-synchronous orbit (SSO) missions. Located in Kelan County, Shanxi province, TSLC's Launch Complex 2 has been operational for several decades and is primarily utilized for launching the Long March series of rockets, including the Long March 4C and Long March 6.

As one of China's key inland launch sites, LC-2 has been instrumental in supporting a wide array of Earth observation, weather, and scientific satellite deployments. With its capabilities optimized for high-inclination launches, the facility plays a strategic role in China's growing space ambitions and ongoing advancements in satellite technology. Notable missions from this complex have contributed to both national projects and international collaborations.
