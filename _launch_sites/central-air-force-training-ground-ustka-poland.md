The Central Air Force Training Ground (Polish: Centralny Poligon Sił Powietrznych) is a significant military proving ground located along the Baltic coast near Ustka, Poland. Originally established during the Cold War, the site has been pivotal for Polish military readiness and research, serving as a venue for air defense exercises, live-fire drills, and the evaluation of a variety of missile and rocket systems.

The facility is operated jointly by the Polish Air Force and the Military Institute of Armament Technology (WITU). It has hosted a range of activities, from artillery training to the testing of indigenous rocket and missile programs, such as the TRS and experimental single-stage demonstrator vehicles. Its strategic location and infrastructure make it one of Poland's premier centers for military technology testing and training.
