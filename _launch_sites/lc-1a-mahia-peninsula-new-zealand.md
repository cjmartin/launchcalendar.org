Launch Complex 1A (LC-1A) is part of Rocket Lab's Launch Complex 1 (LC-1), situated on the Mahia Peninsula in New Zealand. Opened in 2017, it is notable for being the world's first privately owned and operated orbital launch site. The site was constructed to support the Electron launch vehicle, which is designed for frequent, low-cost launches of small satellites into low Earth orbit. 

LC-1A has facilitated numerous successful launches for commercial, civil, and government customers, cementing Rocket Lab's position as a major player in the small satellite launch market. The location was chosen for its remote setting, access to a range of orbital inclinations, and minimal air and sea traffic, enabling a high launch cadence and flexibility for customers.
