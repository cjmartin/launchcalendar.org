Orbital Launch Pad A (OLP-A), located at SpaceX's Starbase complex near Boca Chica, Texas, is dedicated to orbital-class launches of the Starship vehicle. Constructed specifically for the development and deployment of SpaceX's next-generation fully reusable spacecraft, OLP-A features a robust launch mount, extensive ground support infrastructure, and has been central to Starship's integrated flight tests beginning in 2023.

The site is part of SpaceXâ€™s ambition to drastically lower the cost of access to space and enable missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. OLP-A has witnessed major milestones, including the maiden integrated orbital test flights of Starship and Super Heavy. The pad continues to be a focal point for technological innovation, rapid iteration, and high-frequency launch operations in pursuit of interplanetary transportation.
