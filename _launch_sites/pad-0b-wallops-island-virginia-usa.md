Pad 0B, also known as Launch Pad 0B, is part of the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) situated on Wallops Island, Virginia, adjacent to the NASA Wallops Flight Facility. Designed for small-class rockets, Pad 0B was first used in 2006 and has since hosted multiple launches with vehicles such as the Minotaur I and Minotaur IV, supporting both commercial and government customers, including several national security payloads for the U.S. government.

Operated by the Virginia Commercial Space Flight Authority (Virginia Space) in partnership with NASA, Pad 0B features facilities tailored for rapid and cost-effective launch operations for smaller payloads. The site has been an important asset in expanding US civilian and military access to space from the East Coast, reflecting ongoing investments in commercial launch infrastructure.
