ELA-3, or Ensemble de Lancement Ariane 3, is the principal launch complex for the Ariane 5 launch vehicle at the Guiana Space Centre near Kourou, French Guiana. The pad was completed in 1996 to support the transition from Ariane 4 to the more powerful Ariane 5 family, which has played a vital role in deploying satellites for telecommunications, scientific research, and space exploration on behalf of European and international customers.

Over the years, ELA-3 has been the departure point for numerous high-profile missions, including launches of scientific payloads like the James Webb Space Telescope and Galileo navigation satellites. Its location near the equator offers a valuable advantage for launching payloads into geostationary and other orbits, making it one of the world’s most important spaceports. The team at Arianespace and ESA continue to maintain and operate the site, marking it as a cornerstone of Europe’s space infrastructure.
