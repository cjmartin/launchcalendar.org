Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) is a historic launch site located at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. Built in the 1960s, it was originally used for Titan III and Titan IV launches, supporting a variety of military, intelligence, and interplanetary missions. After a period of inactivity, SpaceX leased and extensively modified SLC-40 in the 2000s to launch Falcon 9 rockets.

Since becoming operational for SpaceX in 2010, SLC-40 has become a principal hub for commercial, governmental, and crewed missions aboard Falcon 9. The pad has seen dozens of launches annually, significantly contributing to America's presence in space exploration, satellite deployment, and servicing the International Space Station.
