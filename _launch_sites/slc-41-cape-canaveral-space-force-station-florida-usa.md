Space Launch Complex 41 (SLC-41) is a prominent rocket launch pad located at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. Originally constructed in the 1960s for the Titan III and Titan IV rocket families, SLC-41 was later refurbished to accommodate United Launch Alliance's Atlas V vehicle, and more recently, the Vulcan Centaur rocket. The site has played a critical role in launching key missions to Mars, Jupiter, and Pluto, including the Mars Science Laboratory and New Horizons. 

SLC-41's modern facilities support a wide range of commercial, scientific, and military missions. Its distinctive clean-pad design enables efficient vehicle processing and rapid launch cadence. The pad continues to be central to ULA's operations as newer launch vehicles like Vulcan Centaur take to the skies from this historic site.
