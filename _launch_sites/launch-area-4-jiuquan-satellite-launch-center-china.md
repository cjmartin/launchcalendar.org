Launch Area 4 at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center, notably including Pad 921, is the only launch complex in China certified for crewed missions and the starting point for all Shenzhou human spaceflight launches. Operated by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), this site has played a central role in the Chinese human space program since 1999, facilitating launches of Shenzhou spacecraft as well as important uncrewed missions.

Site 921 comprises two launch pads: 921/1 (used for human spaceflight with the Long March 2F) and 921/2 (primarily for Long March 4C launches). The area has witnessed all significant milestones in China’s crewed spaceflight history, including the first Chinese astronaut, Yang Liwei's launch in 2003, and subsequent Tiangong missions. Its strategic location in northwestern China and comprehensive facilities make it a cornerstone of China’s ambitions in space exploration.
