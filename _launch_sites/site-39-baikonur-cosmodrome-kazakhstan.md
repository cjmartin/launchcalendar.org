Site 39 (also known as Pad 39 or Launch Complex 39) is one of several Proton launch pads at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan. Built in the early 1960s, the complex has supported a wide array of launches for both governmental and commercial payloads, with the first usage dating back to the debut years of the Proton rocket family.

Over the decades, Site 39 has been instrumental in enabling many important missions, including satellite deployments, planetary probes, and space station modules. Managed by Roscosmos, it continues to be critical for the Russian space program, principally launching Proton and Proton-M rockets for both domestic and international stakeholders.
