Site 31, also known as Site 31/6, is one of the primary launch facilities at Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Commissioned in 1961, it was originally built as a backup to the legendary Site 1 and has supported launches of various versions of the Soyuz rocket, including both crewed and uncrewed missions. Over the decades, it has played a crucial role in the Soviet and Russian space programs, notably supporting launches when Site 1 has been unavailable due to maintenance or upgrades.

Following the 2019 crewed launch from Site 1, Site 31/6 temporarily became the only operational crew launch pad at Baikonur while Site 1 underwent renovations. The site continues to be a vital part of Roscosmos operations, regularly supporting launches of Soyuz-2 and other Soyuz variants for both human and cargo missions to low Earth orbit, including resupply flights to the International Space Station.
