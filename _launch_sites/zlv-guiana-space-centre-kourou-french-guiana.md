ZLV, or Zone de Lancement Vega, is a specialized launch complex located within the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana. Constructed on the site of the former ELA-1 pad, it was extensively refurbished to support the European Space Agency's Vega family of small-lift launch vehicles. Since its first use in 2012, ZLV has enabled Europe to deploy smaller payloads to low Earth orbit as well as sun-synchronous orbits, complementing the larger Ariane and Soyuz launch capabilities at the centre.

ZLV plays a strategic role in European space access by hosting launches for Vega and its upgraded variant, Vega-C. The pad features dedicated infrastructure for solid-propellant vehicles, including a mobile gantry and systems tailored to payload preparation and vehicle integration. Its operational flexibility supports a broad range of scientific, commercial, and governmental missions, reinforcing Europe's independent access to space.
