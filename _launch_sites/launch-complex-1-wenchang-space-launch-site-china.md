Launch Complex 1 (LC-101) at the Wenchang Space Launch Site, situated on Hainan Island, is the southernmost and newest major orbital launch facility of China. Commissioned in 2014 and operated by CASC, the site takes advantage of its low latitude to maximize payload efficiency on missions to geostationary and lunar orbits. LC-1 is designed to accommodate China's largest launch vehicles, including the Long March 5, 5B, and 7, enabling the country to conduct heavy-lift missions such as lunar, deep space, and space station resupply.

Wenchang has played a pivotal role in China's recent space ambitions, hosting significant launches such as the Tianhe core module for the Chinese space station and interplanetary missions like Tianwen-1 to Mars. Its modern infrastructure and unique seaside location distinguish it from other Chinese spaceports, positioning it as a cornerstone for the country's future space exploration endeavors.
