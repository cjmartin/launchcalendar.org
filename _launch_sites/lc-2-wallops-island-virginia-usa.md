Launch Complex 2 (LC-2) at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility, located on Wallops Island in Virginia, USA, serves as Rocket Lab's first U.S.-based launch site. Constructed to provide dedicated support for Electron rocket missions catering to both government and commercial clients, LC-2 complements Rocket Lab's primary launch operations from Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand. 

The pad was inaugurated in December 2019, with its first Electron launch from U.S. soil occurring in January 2023. LC-2 enables increased mission flexibility and rapid launch cadence for payloads such as small satellites and research missions, benefiting from close proximity to the United States' robust aerospace infrastructure. The facility highlights Rocket Lab's commitment to providing responsive launch services to North American and allied customers.
