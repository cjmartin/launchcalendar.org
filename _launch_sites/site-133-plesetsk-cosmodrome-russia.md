Site 133 at Plesetsk Cosmodrome is a launch pad that has been specifically adapted for the operation of the Rockot launch vehicle, a derivative of the UR-100N intercontinental ballistic missile. Since its conversion from a missile launch facility in the 1990s, Site 133 has supported various commercial and military satellite launches.

Having become the primary site for Rockot launches after changes in Russia's political landscape, Site 133 has contributed to numerous successful missions, deploying Earth observation, communication, and navigational satellites into orbit. Its retirement is planned in line with the Rockotâ€™s phase-out, as Russia transitions to newer launch systems.
