Launch Complex 39B (LC-39B) is one of the two historic launch pads at Kennedy Space Center, originally constructed for the Apollo program's Saturn V launches in the 1960s. After serving as a launch site for Apollo missions, it was modified for use by the Space Shuttle program, supporting several significant crewed missions over three decades, including some of the first and last Shuttle flights.

In recent years, pad 39B has been extensively refurbished to accommodate NASA's new Space Launch System (SLS), designed for deep space exploration and the Artemis program. The pad is notable for its "clean pad" design, minimizing fixed infrastructure and allowing flexible support for multiple vehicle types. LC-39B has cemented itself as a cornerstone of American crewed and uncrewed space launch history.
