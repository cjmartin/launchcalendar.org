The Minuteman Launch Area at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California comprises a network of silos and launch facilities dedicated to test-firing the Minuteman series of intercontinental ballistic missiles. Since the 1960s, Vandenberg has served as the main West Coast site for the development, operational testing, and evaluation of these land-based strategic missiles, supporting both research and training for missile crews.

The site has supported multiple generations of Minuteman missiles, most notably the Minuteman III, with launches conducted to verify system reliability and support treaty verification measures. The facilities are operated by the United States Air Force, working in collaboration with the newly established United States Space Force, underscoring the baseâ€™s continued importance in the nation's strategic defense posture.
