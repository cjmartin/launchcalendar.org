Space Launch Complex 8 (SLC-8), formerly known as Launch Complex 8 (LC-8), is a small launch pad located at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. Initially built to support the launch of Minotaur family rockets, it has been the site for a number of government and experimental satellite missions since its first launch in 2000. The complex is operated by the US Space Force and is part of the infrastructure supporting responsive and cost-effective launch capabilities.

SLC-8 is primarily utilized for Minotaur IV and Minotaur-C (formerly Taurus) launches, providing rapid access to polar and sun-synchronous orbits for a variety of payloads, mostly for military or government customers. The facility is notable for its support of smaller, solid-fueled rockets compared to the larger launch complexes at Vandenberg.
