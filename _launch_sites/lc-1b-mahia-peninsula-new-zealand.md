Launch Complex 1B (LC-1B) is the second pad at Rocket Lab's Launch Complex 1, located on the Mahia Peninsula in New Zealand. Built to supplement the original LC-1A pad, LC-1B allows Rocket Lab to conduct more frequent and flexible launches of its Electron rocket, supporting diverse payloads for commercial, scientific, and government customers.

LC-1B, like its adjacent counterpart, is part of Rocket Lab's effort to provide rapid and reliable access to orbit from a private facility. Its addition has increased the launch cadence and operational redundancy at the site, further cementing Mahia Peninsula as a significant hub for commercial space launches in the Southern Hemisphere.
