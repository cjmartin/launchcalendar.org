Launch Complex 36 (SLC-36) at Cape Canaveral has played a significant role in American space history. Constructed in the early 1960s, SLC-36 was originally built for the Atlas-Centaur rocket program, supporting over a hundred launches, including notable planetary missions such as Surveyor, Pioneer, and Mariner, which helped pave the way for lunar and interplanetary exploration. The complex consisted of two pads, 36A and 36B, both of which saw extensive use until their Atlas-era retirement in 2005.

Following a period of dormancy, SLC-36 was leased by Blue Origin in 2015 for development as the launch site for its New Glenn, a heavy-lift orbital launch vehicle. Blue Origin has since refurbished and modernized the facilities, constructing new infrastructure tailored for New Glenn launches, signaling the site's transition from historic government launches to a new era of commercial spaceflight.
