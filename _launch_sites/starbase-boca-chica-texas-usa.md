Starbase, formerly known as the SpaceX South Texas Launch Site, is located at Boca Chica near Brownsville, Texas. SpaceX selected this coastal site to develop, test, and launch the Starship launch vehicleâ€”a fully reusable spacecraft and booster system designed for missions to Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars, and beyond. The facility includes an integrated test complex, launch pad, and rocket production infrastructure.

Since its inception in the mid-2010s, Starbase has been the center of SpaceX's ambitious Starship program, witnessing a series of prototype launches and test flights. The site has become notable for its rapid pace of iteration and frequent high-profile flight tests, many of which have garnered significant public and media attention. As SpaceX continues to develop Starship for crewed and uncrewed missions, Starbase remains a focal point for next-generation space exploration.
