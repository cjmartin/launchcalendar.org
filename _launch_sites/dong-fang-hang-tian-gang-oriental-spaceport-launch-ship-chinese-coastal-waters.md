The Dong Fang Hang Tian Gang (Oriental Spaceport Launch Ship) is a sea-based mobile launch platform used by Galactic Energy, a Chinese commercial space company, for launching its Ceres-1S (Gushenxing-1S) solid-fueled rockets. Operating in the coastal waters of China, the ship-based spaceport provides increased flexibility in launch trajectories and reduces risk to populated areas by conducting launches at sea.

This maritime launch capability is part of China's broader strategy to develop commercial space launch infrastructure and improve competitive access to orbit. The Oriental Spaceport Launch Ship has played a pivotal role in demonstrating reliable sea launches for Galactic Energy, making it one of the key assets in China's rapidly evolving commercial space sector.
