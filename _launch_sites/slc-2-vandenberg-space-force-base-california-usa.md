Space Launch Complex 2 (SLC-2), located at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, consists of two pads: SLC-2E and SLC-2W. Primarily, SLC-2W has been used for dozens of launches, supporting vehicles such as the Thor and Delta families since its inception in 1958. Over decades of service, it has supported many significant government and commercial satellite launches.

After being decommissioned for Delta II launches in 2018, SLC-2W underwent refurbishment and is currently operated by Firefly Aerospace for its Alpha small launch vehicle. This transition marks SLC-2â€™s ongoing role in advancing space access, from early Cold War-era launches to supporting new commercial space endeavors.
