ELA-4 (Ensemble de Lancement Ariane 4) is the newest launch pad at the Guiana Space Centre near Kourou, French Guiana. Specifically constructed to accommodate the Ariane 6 launch vehicle, the pad represents a significant expansion of European launch capabilities and infrastructure. ELA-4 incorporates modern design features and advanced safety measures to support both Ariane 62 and Ariane 64 variants.

Construction on ELA-4 began in 2015, with the complex officially inaugurated in 2021 as part of the preparations for Ariane 6's first flight. The site features a large mobile gantry, fueling facilities, and integration buildings, and it aims to replace the aging ELA-3 for future heavy-lift missions. ELA-4 plays a central role in maintaining European autonomous access to space.
