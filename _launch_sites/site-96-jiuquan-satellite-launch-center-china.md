Site 96 at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center is one of the dedicated launch pads operated by Landspace, a leading Chinese private aerospace company. This site serves as the primary launch facility for the ZhuQue-2E rocket, supporting China's expanding capabilities in commercial spaceflight and satellite deployment.

Jiuquan is historically significant as China's oldest and most utilized space launch facility, hosting both government and, more recently, private sector missions. Site 96 marks a milestone in the integration of private launch operations at a traditionally state-run spaceport, reflecting China's efforts to foster commercial space industry growth. Notably, the ZhuQue-2E rocket launched from this site is part of China's push toward advanced orbital access and reusable launch systems.
