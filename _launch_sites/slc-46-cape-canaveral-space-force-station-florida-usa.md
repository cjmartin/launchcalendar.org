Space Launch Complex 46 (SLC-46) is located at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida and has played a multifaceted role in both military and commercial space launches. Originally constructed in the 1980s for the U.S. Navy's Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missile testing, the siteâ€™s capabilities have since been expanded to support a variety of other launch vehicles, most notably the Minotaur IV. 

Currently operated by Space Florida, SLC-46 has hosted several key launches, including government-sponsored missions and commercial payloads. Its flexible infrastructure and strategic location on the Florida Space Coast make it an important asset for the expanding space industry. The pad has supported operations for NASA, the Department of Defense, and commercial partners, demonstrating its adaptability and ongoing relevance in modern spaceflight.
