  Launch Complex 18A (LC-18A) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was a launch
  site used by the U.S. Navy primarily for Vanguard rocket launches during the
  late 1950s. It played a key role in early U.S. satellite and sounding rocket
  missions during the International Geophysical Year.

Launch Complex 18A (often referred to simply as LC-18) is situated at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida and was constructed in the mid-1950s for the U.S. Navy's Vanguard program, a project aimed at launching the first American satellites. From 1956 to 1960, the complex supported numerous launches of the Vanguard rocket family, which were part of the United States' contributions to the International Geophysical Year (IGY).

Although the Vanguard program experienced several high-profile failures, it ultimately succeeded in placing Vanguard 1 in orbit, with LC-18A instrumental to these efforts. After the end of the Vanguard program, the complex continued to support various sounding rocket and test launches, playing a historic role in the early days of U.S. space exploration. Today, LC-18 is no longer in active use, but it remains a significant site in the history of American rocketry.
