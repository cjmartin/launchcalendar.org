Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) is one of the most significant and iconic launch pads in spaceflight history, situated at NASA's Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida. Constructed in the 1960s for the Apollo program, it was the launch site of Apollo 11—the first crewed mission to land on the Moon—and later adapted for the Space Shuttle program, supporting dozens of launches over several decades.

In 2014, NASA began leasing LC-39A to SpaceX, marking a new era for the launch site. SpaceX has extensively modified the facility to support Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches, and is further upgrading the pad for Starship missions. The site is a focal point for both crewed and uncrewed flights to the International Space Station, national security launches, and commercial missions, continuing its legacy as a cornerstone of American space exploration.
