Andøya Spaceport, situated on the northern part of Andøya island in Nordland county, Norway, is a modern launch facility developed to support the growing market for small and medium-lift orbital launches. Operated by Andøya Space (formerly known as Andøya Space Center), the spaceport complements the long-standing suborbital sounding rocket and balloon operations at Andøya and aims to boost Norway's presence in the European and global space industries.

The spaceport's construction began in 2021, with the goal of accommodating launches of commercial vehicles like Isar Aerospace's Spectrum rocket. Andøya Spaceport is strategically located to provide access to various polar and sun-synchronous orbits, making it an attractive site for satellite launches. Upon completion, it will be the first orbital launch site in Europe for private enterprises, representing a major step forward for the region's space capabilities.
