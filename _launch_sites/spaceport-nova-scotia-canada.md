Spaceport Nova Scotia, situated near Canso in Nova Scotia, is poised to become Canada's first commercial orbital spaceport. Developed and operated by Maritime Launch Services, the facility will support both medium and small-class rocket launches, with a primary focus on the Ukrainian-built Cyclone-4M rocket. The site has been selected for its remote location and optimal trajectory conditions for polar and sun-synchronous orbits.

Construction of Spaceport Nova Scotia began in late 2021, and the first launches are anticipated to take place in the mid-2020s. The project marks a significant milestone for Canadian space infrastructure, aiming to position the country as a player in global commercial space launches. In addition to planned Cyclone-4M flights, the spaceport may see operations from other launch vehicles, such as Barracuda, and contribute to regional economic growth and the expansion of Canada's aerospace sector.
