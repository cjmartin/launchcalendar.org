SaxaVord Spaceport, located on Unst, the northernmost of the Shetland Islands in Scotland, serves as a key site for the UK's emerging space launch industry. Operated by SaxaVord Spaceport, the complex aims to facilitate commercial launches to polar and sun-synchronous orbits, offering infrastructure for a variety of small to medium launch vehicles. Launch Pad Fredo is one of the site's dedicated launch pads earmarked for use by companies such as Rocket Factory Augsburg (RFA), Skyrora, and ABL Space Systems.

The spaceport has been developed in response to the UK's National Space Strategy, providing the country with its own orbital launch capability for the first time. SaxaVord has attracted attention for its geographic advantage for high-latitude orbits and its role in revitalizing space activities in the region. The site is expected to host its first launches in the mid-2020s and aims to become a major hub for European commercial spaceflight.
