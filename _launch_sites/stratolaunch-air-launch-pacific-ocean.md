Stratolaunch Air Launch refers to the mobile launch capability operated by the American aerospace company Stratolaunch, using the uniquely large ROC carrier aircraft. Launches typically commence from runways such as the Mojave Air and Space Port, with the aircraft carrying payloads—such as the Talon-A hypersonic vehicle—to suitable locations over the Pacific Ocean for in-flight release and ignition. This air launch approach allows for flexible mission planning, optimal launch conditions, and quick turnaround between flights.

Originally conceived for launching orbital rockets, Stratolaunch has shifted its focus to hypersonic testbeds and research vehicles like Talon-A. The platform demonstrates significant operational advantages, such as bypassing many weather and range constraints of ground-based launch sites. The unique nature of ROC and its potential for reusable, rapid deployment makes Stratolaunch Air Launch a notable innovation in modern aerospace operations.
