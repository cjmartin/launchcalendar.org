Site 43, located at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northwestern Russia, is one of the key launch complexes operated by the Russian Ministry of Defence. Since its activation in 1965, the site has played a significant role in launching various versions of the R-7 family of rockets, most notably the Soyuz series, for both military and civil space missions. The complex consists of two pads, 43/3 and 43/4, both historically notable for supporting a large number of launches including reconnaissance, navigation, and scientific satellites.

Throughout the Soviet and post-Soviet periods, Site 43 has been instrumental in supporting Russia's space activities beyond the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Its continual upgrades allow it to handle modern Soyuz-2 rockets, ensuring the site's relevance in Russia's current and future space operations. Site 43's long and active history underscores its importance within Russia's national launch infrastructure.
