LC-3, located within the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) on Wallops Island, Virginia, is a dedicated launch pad constructed for Rocket Lab's Neutron rocket. Announced in 2021, this pad marks Rocket Lab's first U.S.-based launch complex for Neutron, supporting the company's ambitions in medium-lift commercial spaceflight alongside their established Electron small-lift platform. Operated and managed by Virginia Space, LC-3 leverages Wallops Island's strategic position on the U.S. East Coast, providing access to a wide range of orbital inclinations.

The development of LC-3 is a significant milestone for both Rocket Lab and MARS, expanding the site's capabilities and increasing the region's prominence in the commercial launch sector. The facility includes advanced infrastructure tailored to Neutron's reusable design and rapid-launch requirements, underscoring the growing demand for flexible, high-frequency launch operations from U.S. spaceports.
