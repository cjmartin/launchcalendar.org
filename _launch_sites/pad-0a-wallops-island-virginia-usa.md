Pad 0A, also known as Launch Pad 0A, is part of the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) facility located on Wallops Island, Virginia. Originally developed for the Conestoga rocket in the 1990s, it was later reconstructed to serve as the launchpad for Orbital Sciences' (now Northrop Grumman's) Antares rocket, which conducts cargo resupply missions to the International Space Station under NASA's Commercial Resupply Services program.

Operated by Virginia Space in partnership with NASA, Pad 0A has played a significant role in the expansion of commercial spaceflight in the United States. The site features a liquid-fueled launch complex and modern integration facilities. Since 2013, numerous Antares missions have launched from this pad, including critical resupply flights and payload deliveries to the ISS, reinforcing its importance in the nation's space launch infrastructure.
