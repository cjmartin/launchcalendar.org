The Ensemble de Lancement Soyouz (ELS) is a dedicated launch facility at the Guiana Space Centre, Kourou, designed for European Soyuz rocket launches. Developed as a collaboration between ESA, Arianespace, and Roscosmos, ELS allows Soyuz-ST vehicles to take advantage of the center's proximity to the equator, resulting in increased payload capacities.

Since its inauguration in October 2011 with the launch of two Galileo navigation satellites, ELS has been the site for various commercial and scientific missions. Soyuz launches from ELS have included payloads such as Galileo navigation satellites and O3b communications satellites. Operations were suspended in 2022 following geopolitical developments between Russia and its partners.
