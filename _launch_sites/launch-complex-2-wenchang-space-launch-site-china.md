Located on Hainan Island, Wenchang Space Launch Site's Launch Complex 2 is one of China's most advanced and recently constructed launch pads. It was developed specifically to accommodate new-generation, medium- and heavy-lift Long March launch vehicles designed for both crewed and uncrewed missions. This pad plays a pivotal role in China's space ambitions, launching payloads to low Earth orbit and supporting high-profile projects such as Tianzhou cargo missions to the Chinese Space Station.

The geographic advantage of Wenchang allows rockets to launch eastward over the sea, maximizing performance and safety. Since becoming operational in 2016, Launch Complex 2 has featured prominently in China's efforts to modernize and expand its space activities, including international payload launches and key national missions.
