Spaceport America, situated near Truth or Consequences, New Mexico, is the world's first purpose-built commercial spaceport. Officially opened in 2011, the facility was developed by the New Mexico Spaceport Authority and is designed to serve as a base for commercial spaceflight, testing, and aerospace research. The spaceport features modern infrastructure, including a dedicated horizontal launch runway and vertical launch pads, accommodating a variety of launch vehicles.

Virgin Galactic has established Spaceport America as the home base for its space tourism program, launching crewed suborbital flights using the SpaceShipTwo spaceplane. The facility has also hosted launches by UP Aerospace, which uses the SpaceLoft sounding rocket for scientific and commercial payloads, as well as technology demonstrations by companies like SpinLaunch. Spaceport America's innovative approach has contributed to the emergence of the commercial spaceflight industry and positioned New Mexico as an important regional hub for aerospace activities.
