Launch Site One, situated at Blue Origin's Corn Ranch in West Texas, is a private launch facility designed for the company's New Shepard suborbital rocket. Since its first test flights in 2015, the site has supported development, uncrewed test launches, and eventually crewed missions as part of Blue Origin's goal to advance space tourism and research payload flights.

The facility includes launch infrastructure, landing pads, an operations center, and accommodations for crew and tourists. Launch Site One played a historic role in Blue Origin's human spaceflight program, hosting the first New Shepard crewed flight on July 20, 2021, with passengers including Jeff Bezos and Wally Funk. The site remains central to Blue Origin's ongoing New Shepard missions and expansion in commercial space operations.
