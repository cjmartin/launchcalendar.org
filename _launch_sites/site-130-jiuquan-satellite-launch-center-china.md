Site 130 at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center is used by CAS Space, a commercial Chinese space company, for the launch of its Lijian-1 (also known as Kinetica-1) rocket. The facility reflects the increasing role of private and commercial companies in China's rapidly expanding space program. 

CAS Space began operating from Site 130 in 2022, with the inaugural launch of Lijian-1 marking the debut of one of China's most capable solid-fueled launch vehicles. The site is equipped to support horizontal assembly and integration, streamlining launch preparations for rapid flight cadence. Its utilization marks a significant milestone in fostering commercial launch activity at state-run launch centers in China.
