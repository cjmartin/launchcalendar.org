Launch Complex 3 at the Xichang Satellite Launch Center (XSLC) is one of the primary pads utilized by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) for both national and international satellite launches. Since its commissioning in the mid-1980s, LC-3 has hosted a significant number of successful launches, including those for the BeiDou navigation system, communication satellites, and various geostationary payloads using the Long March series launch vehicles, notably the Long March 3B and Long March 2C.

Located in Sichuan province, the Xichang center and its LC-3 pad have played a critical role in China's space program. The facility supports not only domestic satellite launches but is also part of China's commercial space launch offerings. Its remote mountainous location provides safety advantages for high-energy launches and reentries.
