LC-201 is one of the main pads at the Wenchang Space Launch Site, China's southernmost orbital launch complex, located on Hainan Island. Managed by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), this site was constructed to accommodate larger and more advanced launch vehicles, including the Long March 7 and Long March 7A, which are used for missions such as cargo launches to the Chinese space station and deploying satellites in various orbits.

Wenchang Space Launch Site entered operation in the mid-2010s and features cutting-edge infrastructure to support China's growing ambitions in space exploration. The site's coastal location enables safer flight paths over the sea and facilitates the transporter-erector-rocket rollouts by ship. LC-201, as one of its active pads, plays a crucial role in China's human spaceflight and orbital launch program, handling a significant portion of recent Chinese space station and cargo delivery missions.
