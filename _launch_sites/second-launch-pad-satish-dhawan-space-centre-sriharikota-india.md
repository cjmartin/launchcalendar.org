The Second Launch Pad (SLP) is one of two active orbital launch pads at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, India. Commissioned in 2005 and operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), the pad was constructed to accommodate the increasing frequency and scale of India's space launches and to supplement the original First Launch Pad.

Designed as a universal launch pad, the SLP can support multiple launch vehicles, predominantly the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV), and GSLV Mk III. It has been the site of many key missions, including the launches of Chandrayaan and Mangalyaan spacecrafts. Outfitted with modern infrastructure and safety systems, the SLP plays a critical role in India's growing space ambitions and international launch capabilities.
