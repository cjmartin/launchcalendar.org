Site 1, often referred to as Gagarin's Start, is the oldest and most iconic launch pad at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Commissioned in the late 1950s, it was the site of the world's first human spaceflight on April 12, 1961, when Yuri Gagarin was launched into orbit aboard Vostok 1. Since then, it has served as the primary pad for crewed missions to low Earth orbit, including those to the International Space Station. 

Over decades, Site 1 has seen the launch of numerous historic missions and a variety of vehicles, notably the R-7 family and Soyuz-2 rockets. Although its utilization has decreased due to the construction of newer pads and modernization efforts, it remains a symbol of the dawn of human space exploration and a site of significant heritage in both Soviet and Russian space history.
