Site 1S is the primary launch pad at the Vostochny Cosmodrome, located in Russia's Amur Oblast. Built to reduce Russian reliance on the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, Site 1S supports the launch of Soyuz-2 family rockets and is managed by the Russian space agency Roscosmos. The site's construction began in 2012 and was completed in 2016, marking the first new Russian launch complex constructed in the post-Soviet era.

The inaugural launch from Site 1S took place on April 28, 2016, with a Soyuz-2.1a rocket. Since then, it has become the main launch site at Vostochny for crewed and uncrewed missions, supporting Russia's efforts to modernize its space infrastructure and increase independent access to space.
