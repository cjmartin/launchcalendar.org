Space Launch Complex 37B (SLC-37B) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida is one of the siteâ€™s most historically significant launch pads. Originally constructed in the 1960s for the NASA Apollo program, it was the site of Saturn I and Saturn IB launches, contributing to the early stages of America's efforts to reach the Moon. After a period of inactivity, SLC-37B was extensively refurbished to support the Delta IV family of rockets under Boeing and later United Launch Alliance, with its first Delta IV launch in 2002.

SLC-37B has since been used for numerous government and commercial satellite launches, including national security payloads and scientific missions. The pad is also slated to be used for launches of the Vulcan Centaur, ULA's next-generation launch vehicle, continuing its legacy as a key asset in U.S. space operations.
