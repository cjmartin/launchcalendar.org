The Eris Pad at Bowen Orbital Spaceport is operated by Gilmour Space Technologies and is designed for launching the Eris rocket, Australia’s locally developed small-lift orbital launch vehicle. Located near Bowen in North Queensland, this launch site marks a significant milestone in the growth of Australia’s commercial space sector.

Conceived as part of Australia’s expanding space industry ambitions, the Bowen Orbital Spaceport — including the Eris Pad — aims to serve both domestic and international customers seeking orbital launch services. The facility demonstrates Gilmour Space Technologies’ commitment to developing sovereign space access and contributing to Australia's participation in the global space market. As of 2024, the site is poised for some of Australia’s first commercial orbital flight attempts.
