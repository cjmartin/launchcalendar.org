The First Launch Pad (FLP) at Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, is one of two operational orbital launch complexes in India operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Commissioned in 1993, the FLP has served as a critical platform for launching a wide range of Indian satellites, particularly the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) missions.

Over the decades, the FLP has been the site of many landmark missions, playing a pivotal role in India's expanding space program. Notable launches include key Earth observation and navigation satellites that have significantly contributed to both national and international space endeavors. The pad's successful record is a testament to ISRO's engineering and operational excellence.
