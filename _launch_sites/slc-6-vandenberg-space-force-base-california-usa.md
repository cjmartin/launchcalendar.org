  Space Launch Complex 6 (SLC-6) at Vandenberg Space Force Base is a
  historically significant launch site used for polar orbit launches by the
  United States. Originally built for the Manned Orbiting Laboratory, it has
  served multiple space programs including the Space Shuttle and Delta IV, and
  is now operated by United Launch Alliance for Vulcan Centaur launches.

Space Launch Complex 6 (SLC-6), located at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, was originally constructed in the 1960s for the U.S. Air Force's Manned Orbiting Laboratory, a program which was soon cancelled. In the 1980s, SLC-6 was extensively modified for west-coast launches of the Space Shuttle, but after a series of technical and safety setbacks—and the Challenger disaster—the shuttle program at SLC-6 was cancelled without a shuttle ever launching from the site.

Since then, SLC-6 has found new life supporting other launch vehicles, including the Delta IV family and, more recently, is set to support United Launch Alliance's Vulcan Centaur missions. The pad is recognized for its complex engineering history and strategic location, enabling launches into polar and sun-synchronous orbits that are difficult to accomplish from the other U.S. launch ranges.
