On June 8, 2025, at 14:20 UTC, SpaceX launched 26 Starlink v2 Mini satellites as Starlink Group 15-8 aboard Falcon 9 from SLC-4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base. This marked Falcon 9's 70th flight of 2025 and further expands the Starlink megaconstellation, which is nearing 7,700 operational satellites. Booster B1088 completed its seventh successful flight, having previously supported missions such as NROL-126 and Transporter 12, and landed on the droneship 'Of Course I Still Love You' in the Pacific Ocean. Deployment of all satellites into a 70-degree inclined low-Earth orbit was confirmed by SpaceX, as the company continues to target a record 170 orbital launches in 2025.
