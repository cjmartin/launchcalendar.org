Japan plans to launch the GOSAT-GW satellite, the latest in its series for monitoring greenhouse gas emissions, aboard an H2A rocket (No. 50) on June 24, 2025 from Tanegashima Space Center. This satellite introduces a new capability of global survey within three days and higher spatial resolution, allowing detailed city-level air pollution and emissions tracking. GOSAT-GW can measure both CO2 and NO2— a world first— with its findings to be publicly available within two to three days, supporting international climate action and research. The mission is led by JAXA and the National Institute for Environmental Studies.
