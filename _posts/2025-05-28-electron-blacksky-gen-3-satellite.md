Rocket Lab is set to launch a BlackSky Gen-3 Earth-observing satellite to low Earth orbit on May 28, 2025, at 9:15 p.m. EDT (0115 GMT May 29). The mission, named 'Full Stream Ahead,' will lift off from Rocket Lab's New Zealand launch site using an Electron rocket, marking the second in a series of four Electron launches for BlackSky's Gen-3 constellation this year and the 65th overall flight for Electron. The satellite will enhance BlackSkyâ€™s high-resolution imagery and AI-enabled analytics constellation. The launch will be streamed live by Rocket Lab and Space.com.
