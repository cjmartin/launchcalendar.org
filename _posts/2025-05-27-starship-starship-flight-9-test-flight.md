  SpaceX is preparing Ship 35 and Booster 14 for Starship's ninth test flight
  from Starbase, Texas, currently targeted for May 27, 2025, following FAA
  approval after the previous flight's mishap. This mission marks the first
  reuse of a Super Heavy booster and aims to demonstrate vehicle reusability and
  system improvements.

  SpaceX's Ship 35 and Booster 14 will conduct Starship's 9th uncrewed test
  flight, marking the first reflight of a Super Heavy booster. This flight will
  demonstrate vehicle reusability and gather data for further development toward
  Mars exploration. Ship 35 has completed static fire tests, though additional
  testing may be required after a non-nominal six-engine static fire delayed the
  targeted launch window. The mission focuses on reusability and system
  improvements following anomalies in previous Starship flights. The Super Heavy
  booster is being reused from Flight 7.

The FAA has granted SpaceX approval to fly Starship's ninth test flight from Starbase, Texas, now targeting May 27, 2025, after a comprehensive review of the previous flight's mishap, which resulted in destruction of the upper stage but a successful Super Heavy booster catch. This mission uses Ship 35 and the reused Booster 14 (first flown on Flight 7) and will demonstrate reusability and gather data for future Mars exploration. Ship 35 has completed engine and static fire testing, though a six-engine static fire anomaly has caused schedule delays. SpaceX continues to prepare several Starship vehicles and boosters at Starbase. The FAA expanded the hazard area for this flight, highlighting its significance for future lunar and Mars missions.
