  SpaceX is preparing Ship 35 (Block 2) and Booster 14-2 for Starship's ninth
  test flight from Starbase, Texas, currently targeted for May 27, 2025. This
  mission marks the first reuse of a Super Heavy booster and features the
  demonstration deployment of Starlink satellite simulators, in-space engine
  relight, and reusability objectives with a planned water landing for the
  booster.

  SpaceX's Ship 35 (Block 2) and Booster 14-2 (first reflight of a Super Heavy
  booster, previously known as Booster 14) will conduct Starship's 9th uncrewed
  test flight. Objectives include demonstrating vehicle reusability, payload
  deployment demonstration (using eight Starlink satellite simulators, which
  will be deployed on a suborbital trajectory and demise upon entry), in-space
  Raptor engine relight, and reentry tests. Ship 35 has completed static fire
  tests after engine swaps and anomalies which delayed the targeted launch
  window. The booster is planned for a water landing, not a catch attempt, to
  test reentry capabilities. The mission gathers data for further development
  toward Mars exploration and system improvements following previous Starship
  anomalies.

SpaceX will attempt its ninth Starship test flight (Flight 9) no earlier than May 27, 2025, at 23:30 UTC (7:30 p.m. EDT) from Starbase, Texas, after receiving FAA approval. Ship 35 (Block 2) and Booster 14-2 (first-ever Super Heavy booster reflight) are set for final testing and integration. The mission features a demonstration deployment of eight Starlink satellite simulators and an in-space Raptor engine relight test, with Ship 35 expected to follow a suborbital trajectory and Booster 14-2 targeting a soft water landing and recovery. The flight duration should be just over an hour. This test advances Starship system development as SpaceX prepares for Mars exploration, alongside ongoing Block 3 infrastructure upgrades. Backup launch dates are May 28 and 29, with live coverage planned on SpaceX's official channels.
