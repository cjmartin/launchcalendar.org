  SpaceX launched Ship 35 (Block 2) and Booster 14-2 for Starship's ninth
  integrated test flight from Starbase, Texas, on May 27, 2025. The mission
  featured eight Version 3 Starlink satellite simulators, the first booster
  reflight, Block 2 upgrades, heat shield and reentry experiments, an in-space
  Raptor engine relight, and a planned water landing. The payload bay door
  malfunctioned, preventing deployment. Ship 35 lost attitude control during the
  coast phase due to fuel leaks and was lost over the Indian Ocean, while the
  booster was lost following an explosion during its relight and water landing
  attempt. Both stages failed to complete their full objectives, but the flight
  yielded valuable engineering data for rapid Starship program development.

  SpaceX's Ship 35 (Block 2) and Booster 14-2 (the first reflight of a Super
  Heavy booster, previously known as Booster 14) conducted Starship's 9th
  uncrewed test flight, carrying eight Starlink satellite simulators (dummy
  satellites)—large panels simulating the size and mass of Version 3 Starlink
  satellites—along with a suite of heat shield, engine relight, and reentry
  experiment payloads. The main objectives included demonstrating vehicle
  reusability with major Block 2 upgrades, testing in-space Raptor engine
  relight, and using the 'PEZ' payload dispenser for attempted deployment of the
  simulators (ultimately not deployed due to a payload bay door malfunction
  after Ship 35 lost attitude control during coast). The booster was intended
  for a soft water landing (not a catch attempt) in the Gulf of Mexico to test
  reentry and relight, but was lost after an explosion during engine relight.
  Ship 35 suffered fuel leaks and lost control, and was lost over the Indian
  Ocean. The flight lasted just over an hour and provided important data for
  future flights, advancing reusability and heat shield development for the
  Starship program.

On May 27, 2025, at 23:36:30 UTC, SpaceX launched Starship Flight 9 from Starbase, Texas, marking the first reflight of a Super Heavy booster (Booster 14-2) and Block 2 Starship (Ship 35). The mission tested new vehicle reusability, Block 2 upgrades, in-space Raptor engine relight, and attempted deployment of eight Version 3 Starlink satellite simulators using the new 'PEZ dispenser' payload bay, though the bay door failed due to Ship 35 losing attitude control during coast from a propellant leak. Ship 35 passed SECO but lost control and was lost over the Indian Ocean; the booster was lost in the Gulf of Mexico after an explosion during engine relight for soft splashdown. Both stages were lost, but the hour-long test delivered valuable engineering and in-flight data for SpaceX's Starship development. The FAA is investigating the mishap; backup launch windows had been set for May 28 and 29. The mission included spectacular imagery as SpaceX advances toward operational Starship flights for Mars and beyond.
