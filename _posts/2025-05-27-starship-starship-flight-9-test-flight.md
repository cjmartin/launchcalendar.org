  SpaceX launched Ship 35 (Block 2) and Booster 14-2 for Starship's ninth
  integrated test flight from Starbase, Texas, on May 27, 2025. The test marked
  the first reflight of a Super Heavy booster and Block 2 upgrades, tested
  in-space Raptor relight, and carried eight Version 3 Starlink satellite
  simulators, which could not be deployed due to a payload bay door malfunction
  following loss of vehicle control.

  SpaceX's Ship 35 (Block 2) and Booster 14-2 (the first reflight of a Super
  Heavy booster, previously known as Booster 14) performed Starship's 9th
  uncrewed test flight, carrying eight Starlink satellite simulators—large
  panels simulating Version 3 Starlink satellites—and a suite of heat shield,
  engine relight, and reentry experiment payloads. Key objectives included
  demonstrating the reusability of a Super Heavy booster, in-space Raptor engine
  relight, and the use of the new 'PEZ' payload dispenser. While the booster
  (B14-2) performed a successful ascent and boostback, it suffered a rapid
  unscheduled disassembly (RUD) during its landing attempt in the Gulf of
  Mexico. Ship 35 passed SECO but lost attitude control due to a fuel leak and
  RCS issues, leading to an uncontrolled reentry and loss over the Indian Ocean.
  The flight yielded significant reentry and heat shield data to advance future
  Starship flights.

On May 27, 2025, SpaceX launched Starship Flight 9 from Starbase, Texas, marking the world’s first reflight of a Super Heavy booster (Booster 14-2) with Block 2 Starship (Ship 35). This mission, flying from OLP-A, included major Block 2 upgrades and eight Version 3 Starlink satellite simulators inside the new 'PEZ dispenser' bay. Although the simulators could not be deployed due to a payload door malfunction after Ship 35 lost attitude control, the Super Heavy booster performed nominal ascent and boostback before breaking apart during its Gulf of Mexico landing attempt. Ship 35 reached space, passed SECO, but then tumbled and was lost over the Indian Ocean after 46 minutes due to a fuel leak and RCS issues. The FAA opened a mishap investigation, and backup launch dates were set for May 28 and 29. Despite loss of both stages, the nearly hour-long flight returned crucial heat shield, relight, reentry, and Block 2 data for SpaceX’s Starship program ahead of Flight 10.
