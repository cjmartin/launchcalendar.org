  SpaceX is preparing Ship 35 (Block 2) and Booster 14-2 for Starship's ninth
  test flight from Starbase, Texas, currently targeted for May 27, 2025,
  following FAA approval of the previous flight's mishap report. This mission
  marks the first reuse of a Super Heavy booster and aims to demonstrate
  reusability, payload deployment, and system improvements. Booster 14-2 will
  attempt a water landing instead of a catch.

  SpaceX's Ship 35 (Block 2) and Booster 14-2 (first reflight of a Super Heavy
  booster, previously known as Booster 14) will conduct Starship's 9th uncrewed
  test flight. Objectives include demonstrating vehicle reusability, payload
  deployment demonstration, engine ignition in space, and reentry tests. Ship 35
  has completed static fire tests after engine swaps and anomalies which delayed
  the targeted launch window. The booster is planned for a water landing, not a
  catch attempt, to test reentry capabilities. The mission gathers data for
  further development toward Mars exploration and system improvements following
  previous Starship anomalies.

The FAA has cleared SpaceX for Starship's ninth test flight from Starbase, Texas, now targeted for May 27, 2025. Ship 35 (Block 2) and Booster 14-2 are completing final testing and integration, overcoming engine swaps and earlier static fire anomalies. For this mission, Booster 14-2 will not make a catch attempt but will target a water landing to further test reentry and recovery. This mission marks the first Super Heavy booster re-flight and seeks to demonstrate vehicle reusability, payload deployment demonstration, and system improvements. The launch is a critical milestone as SpaceX prepares for future Mars exploration, while ongoing Starbase infrastructure upgrades and preparations for Block 3 vehicles continue.
