A Russian government Proton rocket with a Breeze M upper stage deployed the European Space Agency's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter. The mission will make improved measurements of trace gases in the Martian atmosphere, such as methane, which could be an indicator of biological activity. ESA's Schiaparelli lander accompanied the Trace Gas Orbiter to Mars.
