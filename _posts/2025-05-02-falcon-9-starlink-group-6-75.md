SpaceX is scheduled to launch Starlink Group 6-92 on May 6, 2025, deploying 28 Starlink small satellites into low-Earth orbit from SLC-40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. Liftoff is set for 8:22 p.m. ET (00:22 UTC on May 6), with backup windows into May 7. The mission uses a Falcon 9 booster on its seventh flight, targeting a droneship landing on Just Read the Instructions in the Atlantic Ocean. This launch continues SpaceX's record-setting pace from SLC-40—site of past milestones like the 250th Falcon mission and the ongoing expansion of advanced Starlink capabilities. The launch will be streamed live on SpaceX’s Twitter/X account and the X TV app.
