The Starlink Group 6-75 mission lifted off on May 2, 2025 at 01:51 UTC from SLC-40, Cape Canaveral. Falcon 9 booster B1080 flew for its 18th time, landing successfully on the droneship 'Just Read The Instructions.' The mission delivered 28 v2 Mini Starlink satellites—including Direct-to-Cell units—to a 530 km, 43-degree orbit, matching the record for highest-mass Starlink launch. This was the 51st Falcon 9 launch and 34th dedicated Starlink flight of 2025, as well as the 248th Falcon 9 launch from SLC-40 and 469th overall. Favorable weather supported mission success, and the satellites will maneuver into their final orbits in the coming days.
