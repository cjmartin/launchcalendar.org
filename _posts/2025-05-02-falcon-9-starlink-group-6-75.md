SpaceX successfully launched its Starlink 6-75 mission on May 1, 2025, at 9:51 p.m. EDT (May 2, 01:51 UTC) from SLC-40 (Launch Complex-40) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida. The Falcon 9 rocket delivered 28 Starlink V2 Mini satellites, including Direct-to-Cell units, to a 43-degree, 530 km low Earth orbit, further expanding the broadband constellation to over 7,300 satellites. Booster B1080 made its 18th flight and 12th Starlink mission, landing on the 'Just Read the Instructions' droneship. The satellites will maneuver into their designated orbits over the coming days. Weather conditions at launch were highly favorable, with over a 95% chance of acceptable conditions.
