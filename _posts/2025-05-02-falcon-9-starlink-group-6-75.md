SpaceX plans to launch the Starlink Group 6-75 mission aboard Falcon 9 from SLC-40 at Cape Canaveral on May 2, 2025 at 01:51 UTC. The launch features a mix of v2 Mini and Direct-to-Cell satellites targeting a 43-degree, 530 km low-Earth orbit. The booster is expected to land on a droneship stationed in the Atlantic. This mission marks the 248th Falcon 9 launch from SLC-40.
