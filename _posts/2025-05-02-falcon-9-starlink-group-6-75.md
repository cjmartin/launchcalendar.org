On May 1, 2025, SpaceX successfully launched its Starlink 6-75 mission from SLC-40 (Launch Complex-40) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The Falcon 9 delivered 28 Starlink V2 Mini satellites, including Direct-to-Cell units, into a 43-degree, 530 km low Earth orbit at 9:51 p.m. EDT (May 2, 01:51 UTC). Booster B1080 flew for the 18th time and safely landed on the droneship 'Just Read the Instructions.' With this flight—the 51st Falcon 9 mission and 34th dedicated Starlink launch of 2025—the Starlink constellation grew to over 7,300 satellites. Favorable weather supported mission success, and the satellites will maneuver into their final orbits over the coming days.
