SpaceX will launch the Starlink 6-75 mission aboard a Falcon 9 rocket from SLC-40 at Cape Canaveral, carrying 28 Starlink V2 Mini satellites to a 43-degree, 530 km low-Earth orbit. The launch is scheduled for May 1 at 9:51 p.m. EDT (May 2, 01:51 UTC). Booster B1080 will make its 18th flight, targeting a landing on the droneship 'Just Read the Instructions'. This marks the 248th Falcon 9 launch from SLC-40. Weather conditions are highly favorable, with over a 95% chance of acceptable conditions. Over 7,300 Starlink satellites are already on orbit.
