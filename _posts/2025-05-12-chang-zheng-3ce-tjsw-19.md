A Chang Zheng 3C/E launched TJSW-19, an experimental and classified satellite, into geostationary transfer orbit from Xichang's LC-3 on May 12, 2025. The CZ-3C/E is an enhanced three-stage, two-booster rocket designed for large payloads to LEO or GTO. TJSW-19 continues China's program of deployable, experimental communication or data relay satellites. Previous missions in this series have carried Tianlian data relay or Tongxin Jishu Shiyan satellites. The CZ-3C/E variant's previous flight occurred in July 2021.
