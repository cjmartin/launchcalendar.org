On May 12, 2025, a Chang Zheng 3C/E (CZ-3C/E) rocket launched from Xichang LC-3, carrying the classified TJSW-19 payload to geostationary transfer orbit. The CZ-3C/E is an enhanced three-stage, two-booster rocket designed for large payloads to LEO or GTO. TJSW-19 continues China's program of deployable, experimental communication or data relay satellites. Previous missions in this series have carried Tianlian data relay or Tongxin Jishu Shiyan satellites.
