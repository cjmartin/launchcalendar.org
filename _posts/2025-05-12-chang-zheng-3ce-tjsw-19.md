A Chang Zheng 3C/E launched TJSW-19, an experimental and classified satellite, into geostationary transfer orbit from Xichang's LC-3 on May 12, 2025. The CZ-3C/E is an enhanced three-stage, two-booster rocket designed for large payloads to LEO or GTO. TJSW-19 is believed to serve a military, communications, or intelligence role for China, and continues the country's deployment of experimental relay and data satellites in geostationary orbit. Previous missions in this series have included Tianlian data relay and other Tongxin Jishu Shiyan satellites. The CZ-3C/E variant's previous flight occurred in July 2021.
