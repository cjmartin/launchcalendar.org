  Firefly Aerospace's Alpha rocket launched the FLTA006 'Message In A Booster'
  mission carrying Lockheed Martin's LM400 Pathfinder tech demo satellite from
  SLC-2W, Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, on April 29, 2025. Despite a
  successful liftoff and ascent, a stage separation event led to a failure in
  the upper stage Lightning engine nozzle, which caused a loss of thrust,
  preventing orbital insertion. Both the upper stage and the payload safely
  impacted the Pacific Ocean near Antarctica. The FAA subsequently grounded
  Alpha pending a formal mishap investigation.

  The Lockheed Martin LM400 Pathfinder, a technology demonstration satellite and
  prototype of the LM400 multi-mission bus, was the largest payload yet for
  Firefly's Alpha rocket. Serving as a demonstrator for commercial, civil, and
  military remote sensing and communications, the 'Message in a Booster' mission
  reflects a multi-launch partnership between Lockheed Martin and Firefly
  Aerospace.

Firefly Aerospace’s sixth Alpha rocket flight, FLTA006 'Message In A Booster', lifted off April 29, 2025 at 13:37 UTC from SLC-2W, Vandenberg SFB, carrying Lockheed Martin’s LM400 Pathfinder tech demonstration satellite—the Alpha’s largest payload to date. Despite weather and range delays, the vehicle progressed through stage separation, but a nozzle failure on the Lightning upper stage engine caused a loss of thrust. As a result, the payload did not reach orbit and safely impacted the Pacific Ocean near Antarctica. The FAA grounded Alpha pending a mishap investigation, while Firefly and Lockheed Martin continue pursuing rapid launch advancements.
