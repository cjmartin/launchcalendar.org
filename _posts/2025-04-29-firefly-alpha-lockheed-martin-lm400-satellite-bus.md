  Firefly Aerospace's Alpha rocket launched with Lockheed Martin's LM400
  Pathfinder on the FLTA006 'Message In A Booster' mission from SLC-2W,
  Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, on April 29, 2025. The mission
  suffered a stage separation mishap that resulted in a loss of thrust from the
  Lightning upper stage engine, preventing the satellite from reaching orbit.
  Both the upper stage and payload safely reentered and impacted the Pacific
  Ocean near Antarctica. The FAA grounded Alpha pending a formal mishap
  investigation.

Firefly Aerospace launched its sixth Alpha rocket (FLTA006 'Message In A Booster') on April 29, 2025 at 13:37 UTC from SLC-2W, VSFB, carrying Lockheed Martin’s LM400 Pathfinder tech demonstration satellite—the largest Alpha payload to date. After progressing through stage separation, a failure in the Lightning upper stage engine nozzle caused a loss of thrust. As a result, the payload did not reach orbit and safely reentered into the Pacific Ocean near Antarctica. The FAA grounded Alpha pending a mishap investigation. This was Alpha’s second launch for Lockheed Martin and part of ongoing rapid launch advancements.
