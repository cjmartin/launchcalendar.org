  Firefly Aerospace's Alpha rocket launched Lockheed Martin's LM 400 technology
  demonstrator satellite on the 'Message in a Booster' mission on April 29,
  2025, from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, USA. The sixth flight of
  the Alpha vehicle, this mission was intended to showcase the LM 400 mid-sized
  satellite bus's operational capabilities for commercial, civil, and military
  applications such as remote sensing and communications. However, a separation
  mishap occurred during the upper stage—roughly 12 minutes after
  launch—resulting in the loss of the payload, which impacted the Pacific Ocean
  near Antarctica. The mission experienced previous delays due to weather and
  range restrictions, and was part of a multi-launch deal to validate the
  flexible LM400 satellite platform. Firefly Aerospace and its partners are
  actively investigating the cause of the anomaly, with more Alpha launches
  planned as part of the expanding rapid launch services portfolio.

On April 29, 2025, Firefly Aerospace's Alpha rocket undertook its sixth flight from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, carrying Lockheed Martin's LM 400 satellite technology demonstrator as part of the 'Message in a Booster' mission. After previous delays due to weather and range restrictions, the mission suffered a failure during upper stage separation, resulting in the loss of the payload, which impacted the Pacific Ocean near Antarctica. The launch was intended to demonstrate the operational capabilities of the LM 400 mid-sized satellite bus for commercial, civil, and military applications. Firefly and its partners are investigating the anomaly, with further details and updates expected through official channels. Additional Alpha launches are planned as Firefly expands rapid launch services in 2025.
