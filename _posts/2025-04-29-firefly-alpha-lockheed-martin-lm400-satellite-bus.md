  Firefly Aerospace's Alpha rocket launched the 'Message in a Booster' mission
  from SLC-2W, Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, on April 29, 2025,
  carrying a prototype Lockheed Martin LM 400 technology demonstrator. The
  launch suffered a failure in the upper stage Lightning engine nozzle after
  separation, causing a loss of thrust and preventing orbit insertion. Both the
  upper stage and payload safely impacted the Pacific Ocean near Antarctica. The
  FAA has grounded Alpha pending the results of the formal mishap investigation.

On April 29, 2025, Firefly Aerospace launched its sixth Alpha rocket from SLC-2W at Vandenberg Space Force Base on the 'Message in a Booster' mission, carrying a prototype LM 400 satellite bus from Lockheed Martin. Despite delays due to weather and range restrictions, the mission lifted off at 13:37 UTC; however, after stage separation, a failure of the upper stage Lightning engine nozzle resulted in a loss of thrust and prevented orbital insertion. Both the upper stage and payload safely impacted the Pacific Ocean near Antarctica. The FAA has since grounded Alpha pending the outcome of a mishap investigation, with future launches contingent on corrective actions. Firefly and Lockheed Martin remain committed to advancing rapid launch capability, with up to 25 LM 400 launches planned.
