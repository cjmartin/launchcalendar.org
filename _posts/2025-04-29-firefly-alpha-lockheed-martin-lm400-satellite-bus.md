description: >-
  Firefly Aerospace launched the FLTA006 Alpha rocket on the 'Message In A
  Booster' mission from SLC-2W, Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, USA, on
  April 29, 2025. The vehicle carried Lockheed Martin's LM400 Pathfinder
  technology demonstrator (alternatively referenced as LM 400) to showcase its
  mid-sized satellite bus capabilities for commercial, civil, and military use
  such as remote sensing and communications. This sixth flight of Alpha
  encountered a separation mishap during the upper stage—approximately 12
  minutes after launch—which prevented orbit insertion, resulting in the second
  stage and payload safely impacting the Pacific Ocean near Antarctica. The
  mission, which followed delays due to weather and range restrictions, was part
  of Lockheed Martin's multi-launch agreement, validating the LM400 platform
  with up to 25 future launches planned. Firefly Aerospace and partners are
  actively investigating the cause of the anomaly, with additional Alpha
  launches expected as part of Firefly's expanding rapid launch services
  portfolio.
