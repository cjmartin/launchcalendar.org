Starlink Group 6-93 was originally planned for May 3, 2025, but the launch was rescheduled to May 6, targeting liftoff at 9:17 p.m. EDT (0117 UTC, May 7) from SLC-40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida. Falcon 9 launched 28 Starlink V2 Mini satellites into low Earth orbit, marking the rocket’s 470th launch and SpaceX's 53rd Falcon 9 mission and 36th Starlink launch of 2025. Booster B1085 completed its seventh flight, landing on the droneship 'Just Read the Instructions.' This mission increased the Starlink constellation to more than 7,300 satellites to support global broadband service. Despite minor weather concerns, liftoff occurred without delay, and the mission cost was reported at $52 million.
