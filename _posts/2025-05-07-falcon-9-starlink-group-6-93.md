On May 6, 2025, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched 28 Starlink V2 Mini satellites (the Starlink 6-93 mission) from SLC-40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, at 9:17 p.m. EDT (0117 UTC, May 7). This marked the Falcon 9's 470th launch and SpaceX's 53rd Falcon 9 mission and 36th Starlink launch of 2025. The reusable booster B1085 completed its seventh flight, successfully landing on the droneship 'Just Read the Instructions' about eight minutes after liftoff in the Atlantic Ocean. This mission increased the Starlink constellation to more than 7,300 satellites, supporting SpaceX's global broadband internet service. Despite minor weather concerns, liftoff occurred without delay, continuing the rapid expansion of the Starlink network.
