SpaceX launched its 250th mission from SLC-40, Cape Canaveral, with Falcon 9 boosting 28 Starlink v2 Mini satellites for Group 6-93 into orbit at 01:17 UTC on May 7, 2025. The launch was originally planned for May 3, but was rescheduled and marked the rocket’s 470th launch, SpaceX's 53rd Falcon 9 mission and 36th Starlink launch of 2025. Booster B1085 completed its seventh flight, landing on the droneship 'Just Read The Instructions.' This was the 77th Starlink Group 6 mission and continued SpaceX's trend of increasing payload mass with upgraded satellites, bringing the Starlink constellation to over 7,300 satellites and demonstrating ongoing deployment and Falcon 9 reuse milestones.
