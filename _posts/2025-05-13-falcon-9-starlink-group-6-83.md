SpaceX's Starlink Group 6-83 mission launched 28 Starlink v2 Mini satellites from Kennedy Space Center LC-39A on May 13, 2025, at 11:36 PM EDT (03:36 UTC May 14), after a weather delay. Falcon 9 booster B1067-28 set a new reuse record with its 28th flight, aiming to land on the 'Just Read the Instructions' droneship. This launch expanded SpaceXâ€™s Starlink broadband constellation, marking the 57th Falcon 9 launch of 2025 and continuing the streak of successful flights. Improved weather conditions enabled the mission after an initial scrub, with the webcast available via SpaceX's official channels including X and the X TV app.
