After a weather delay, the Falcon 9 carrying Starlink Group 6-83 was rescheduled to launch from Kennedy's LC-39A on May 13, 2025 at 03:36 UTC. Booster B1067, marking its record 28th flight, will deliver 28 Starlink v2 Mini satellites to orbit and attempt recovery on the droneship 'Just Read The Instructions.' This is the 80th Group 6 mission, the 100th launch of a single-stick Falcon 9 from pad 39A, and SpaceX's 120th consecutive successful Falcon 9 mission since the last failure. The launch was originally postponed due to weather concerns, but improved conditions are expected. The mission underscores milestones in reusability and further expands SpaceX’s Starlink broadband constellation.
