SpaceX is targeting May 13, 2025 at 03:36 UTC for the launch of 28 Starlink v2 Mini satellites aboard a Falcon 9 rocket (Starlink 6-83) from LC-39A at Kennedy Space Center. The Falcon 9 booster, B1067, will be making its record-breaking 28th flight, marking the 100th launch of a single-stick Falcon 9 from pad 39A. The launch was postponed from the previous night due to weather concerns, but improved conditions are expected. If successful, the booster will land on the drone ship 'Just Read the Instructions.' The mission will further expand SpaceX’s Starlink broadband constellation and underscores new milestones in orbital reusability. This is the 99th orbital launch worldwide in 2025.
