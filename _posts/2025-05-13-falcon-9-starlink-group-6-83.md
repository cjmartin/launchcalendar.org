The Starlink Group 6-83 mission, slated to launch 28 v2 Mini satellites from LC-39A at Kennedy Space Center, was rescheduled to May 13, 2025, at 01:15 UTC after a weather-related scrub. Falcon 9 booster B1067 is set to make history as the first to reach 28 launches, delivering another batch for SpaceX’s growing Starlink constellation. This mission marks the 99th orbital launch worldwide in 2025 and includes a planned drone ship landing for B1067, further advancing SpaceX’s reusability milestones.
