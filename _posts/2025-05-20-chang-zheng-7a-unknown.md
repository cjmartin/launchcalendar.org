On May 20, 2025, a Chang Zheng 7A (CZ-7A) rocket launched the Zhongxing-3B (ChinaSat-3B) communications satellite from LC-201 at the Wenchang Space Launch Site at 11:50 UTC. The launch followed a due east trajectory indicated by hazard notices, as CZ-7A completed its second flight of 2025 and tenth overall since its 2020 debut. The Zhongxing-3B adds to China's geostationary communications network, though detailed information about the payload remains limited.
