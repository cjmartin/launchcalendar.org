__Mission Overview__

A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will launch the SES-9 communications satellite from [Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 40](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station_Space_Launch_Complex_40) in Flordia.

The launch of SES-9 was delayed due to the 6 month suspension of Falcon 9 launches following a failure in 2015. Because of this delay, SpaceX agreed to adjust the launch profile for the mission to give the satellite an extra push and reduce the time it will take to reach the desired orbit.

After separation, the first stage of the Falcon 9 will perform reentry and attempt to land on the SpaceX barge [‚ÄúOf Course I Still Love You‚Äù](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_spaceport_drone_ship#Of_Course_I_Still_Love_You_.28Marmac_304.29) in the Atlantic Ocean. Due to the conditions of this launch, the landing is expected to fail.
