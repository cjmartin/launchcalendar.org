Arianespace will use an Ariane 5 ECA rocket, designated VA228, to launch the Intelsat 29e communications satellite. Intelsat 29e is the first Intelsat Epic high throughput satellite, hosting a next-generation all-digital payload that can be reconfigured in orbit and is resilient to interference and jamming. Intelsat 29e offers coverage spanning North and South America, the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, and the North Atlantic aeronautical route connecting North America and Europe.
