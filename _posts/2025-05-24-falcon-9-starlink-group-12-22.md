SpaceX is set to launch Starlink Group 12-22 with a Falcon 9 from SLC-40, Cape Canaveral, on May 24, 2025 at 17:19 UTC (1:19 p.m. EDT). The mission features 23 Starlink v2 Mini satellites, 13 with Direct to Cell technology, to expand SpaceXâ€™s LEO internet constellation and enable enhanced connectivity.

Weather conditions are favorable at the start of the launch window, with an 80% chance of good weather.
