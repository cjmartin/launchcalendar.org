SpaceX launched the NROL-192 mission for the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) on April 12, 2025, from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California. This marks the ninth mission supporting the NRO's 'proliferated architecture,' a strategy focusing on deploying large numbers of small, cost-effective reconnaissance satellites. Details about the specific payload remain classified, but these satellites are believed to be upgraded Starlink models equipped for intelligence gathering. The rapid cadence of these launches began in May 2024, all using Falcon 9 rockets. The Falcon 9's first stage successfully landed on a Pacific Ocean droneship after the launch.
