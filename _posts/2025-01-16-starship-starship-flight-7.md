On January 16, 2025, SpaceX conducted its Starship Flight 7 test launch from Starbase, South Texas. The Super Heavy booster returned safely, but the Ship upper stage exploded over the Atlantic Ocean, with debris splashing down near the Turks and Caicos Islands. The incident, similar to Flight 8, prompted regulatory scrutiny related to debris hazards.
