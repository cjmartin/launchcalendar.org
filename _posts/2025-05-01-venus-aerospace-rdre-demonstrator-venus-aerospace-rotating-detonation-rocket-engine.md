Earlier in May 2025, Venus Aerospace successfully performed the first U.S. flight test of a Rotating Detonation Rocket Engine (RDRE) at Spaceport America in New Mexico. The demonstration marked the first time an engine of this kind, developed by an American company, has flown, providing evidence that the technology works outside the laboratory in real flight conditions. The RDRE offers higher efficiency and compactness than traditional rocket engines, benefiting both defense and commercial aerospace applications. The engine is designed for scalability and will eventually power high-speed transport, with ambitions toward future passenger aircraft capable of Mach 4-6. Venus is progressing toward further integration and full-scale vehicle development.
