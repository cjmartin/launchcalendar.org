Rocket Lab and the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) are partnering for a landmark mission using the Neutron rocket to conduct a Rocket Cargo survivability experiment under the REGAL initiative. Scheduled for no earlier than 2026 from LC-3 at Wallops, the demonstration will test Neutron's reentry and rapid point-to-point cargo delivery capabilities. This partially reusable mission aims to provide vital data for U.S. military logistics and supports national security rapid response scenarios, with a potential debut later in 2025. Neutron’s development continues to move quickly, with its reusability and medium-lift profile making it a key contender for both government and commercial launches. For more insights, refer to Rocket Lab's official press release and recent industry news.
