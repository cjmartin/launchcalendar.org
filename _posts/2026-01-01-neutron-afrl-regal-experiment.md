Rocket Lab has signed a contract with the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory to launch a demonstration mission using its reusable Neutron rocket no earlier than 2026 under the REGAL (Rocket Experimentation for Global Agile Logistics) program. The mission, planned from Launch Complex 3 (LC-3) at MARS (Wallops, Virginia), will be a multi-manifest, return-to-Earth demonstration to showcase re-entry and reusability. This launch aims to rapidly advance military logistics and humanitarian assistance via space-based delivery, supporting the DoD's goal for operational rapid logistics with rockets. Neutron's second stage qualification is complete, with final assembly and integration underway for the first launch. The mission is also tied to the U.S. Space Force's NSSL Phase 3 Lane 1 program, with additional context on landing facilities planned for Johnston Atoll and Rocket Lab prioritizing Neutron development over Electron reusability.
