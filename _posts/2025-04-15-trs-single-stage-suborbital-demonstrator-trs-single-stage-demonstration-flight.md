On 15 April 2025, Poland successfully launched a single-stage suborbital demonstrator rocket from the Central Air Force Training Ground in Ustka as part of the Trójstopniowa Rakieta Suborbitalna (TRS) project. The mission aimed to validate the rocket’s navigation, engine, telemetry, and flight termination systems. The vehicle reached over 10 kilometers altitude before being destroyed by its onboard termination system. This test is a step towards qualifying a three-stage rocket capable of lofting 40-kilogram research payloads above 100 kilometers. The TRS project is a collaboration of several Polish defense and research institutes. Future tests with multiple stages, including a full three-stage flight, are planned for later in 2025.
