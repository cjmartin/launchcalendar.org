On 15 April 2025, Poland successfully launched a single-stage suborbital rocket demonstrator from the Central Air Force Training Ground in Ustka as part of the Trójstopniowa Rakieta Suborbitalna (TRS) project. The mission validated the rocket’s navigation, engine, telemetry, control, and flight termination systems. The vehicle reached over 10 kilometers altitude before being destroyed by its onboard termination system. This test marks a key milestone toward qualifying a three-stage rocket capable of lofting 40-kilogram research payloads above 100 kilometers. The TRS project is a collaboration of several Polish defense and research institutes. Additional tests, including a two-stage version, are scheduled for mid-2025, followed by a full three-stage launch before the end of the year.
