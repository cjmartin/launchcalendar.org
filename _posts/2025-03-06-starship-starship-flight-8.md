On March 6, 2025, SpaceX launched the eighth test flight of its Starship rocket from Starbase, South Texas. The flight saw a successful Super Heavy booster engine burn and the first-ever dramatic catch of the booster by Starbase's launch tower 'chopstick' arms. However, the upper stage, known as Starship or Ship, exploded less than 10 minutes after liftoff, with debris raining down over the Bahamas. The article also highlighted regulatory updates affecting upcoming launches, including FAA license modifications in anticipation of Flight 9.
