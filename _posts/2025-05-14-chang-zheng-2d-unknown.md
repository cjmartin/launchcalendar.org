On May 14, 2025 at 04:12 UTC, a Chang Zheng 2D (CZ-2D) rocket launched 12 ADASPACE-built satellites as part of the Space Computing Constellation from Site 9401 (SLS-2), Jiuquan. The satellites are testing laser inter-satellite communications and AI-driven in-orbit data processing to help form an Earth image data network. It was the fourth CZ-2D launch of the year, with the spacecraft likely destined for Sun-synchronous orbit to support China's growing Earth observation capabilities.
