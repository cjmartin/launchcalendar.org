On May 14, 2025, China's Chang Zheng 2D rocket launched the inaugural set of 12 ADA Space Xingshidai ("Star Age") satellites (Group 01) for the Space Computing Constellation from Site 9401 (SLS-2), Jiuquan. These satellites feature AI processors and laser inter-satellite links for in-orbit data processing and real-time networking. The mission marks the beginning of China's ambitions for an advanced, scalable constellation designed to revolutionize rapid Earth observation with space-based computing and AI-assisted technology.
