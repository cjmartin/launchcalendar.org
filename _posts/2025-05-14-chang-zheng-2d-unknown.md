A Chang Zheng 2D (CZ-2D) rocket launched 12 ADASPACE-built satellites as part of the Space Computing Constellation at 04:12 UTC on May 14, 2025 from Jiuquan. The mission demonstrates laser inter-satellite communications and AI-based in-orbit data processing to enhance China's Earth observation capabilities. It was the fourth CZ-2D launch of the year, with the satellites likely headed to Sun-synchronous orbit to support an Earth image data network.
