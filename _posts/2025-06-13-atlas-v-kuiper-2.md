Amazon's second batch of Project Kuiper internet satellites, known as Kuiper 2, is scheduled to launch on June 13, 2025, at 2:29 p.m. EDT from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, atop a ULA Atlas V rocket. The mission will deliver 27 satellites to low Earth orbit, doubling Amazon's current constellation to 54 satellites as part of its plan to provide global high-speed internet with over 3,200 satellites. The launch window is 30 minutes, and live coverage will be available from Space.com. The article also compares Kuiper with SpaceX's larger Starlink constellation and notes Amazon's focus on sustainability and minimizing orbital debris.
