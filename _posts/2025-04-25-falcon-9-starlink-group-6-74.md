SpaceX successfully launched 28 Starlink V2 Mini satellites on the Starlink 6-74 mission using a Falcon 9 rocket from SLC-40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on April 24, 2025 at 9:52 p.m. EDT (01:52 UTC on April 25). The Falcon 9 booster (B1069) completed its 23rd flight and landed on the droneship 'A Shortfall of Gravitas' in the Atlantic. The satellites were deployed approximately one hour after liftoff into low Earth orbit, where they will maneuver to their operational positions. This was SpaceX's 47th Falcon 9 flight and the 30th Starlink mission of 2025, supporting the continued global expansion of Starlink internet services.
