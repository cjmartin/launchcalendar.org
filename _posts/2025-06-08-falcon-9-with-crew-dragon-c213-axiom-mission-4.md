Axiom Mission 4 (Ax-4) marks the debut of SpaceX's fifth and final Crew Dragon capsule (C213), transporting an international crew of private astronauts—Peggy Whitson (USA), Shubhanshu Shukla (India), Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski (Poland), and Tibor Kapu (Hungary)—to the International Space Station. This fourth private Axiom Space mission is scheduled for launch on June 11, 2025, at 12:00 UTC. The crew will conduct nearly 60 scientific experiments from 31 countries, including research on diabetes management, muscle regeneration, medicine stability, and ocular health in microgravity. C213’s maiden flight was readied for this mission after technical preparations, and the mission was delayed from late May to ensure spacecraft readiness. The crew’s 14-day stay will be the longest yet for an Axiom mission and marks a milestone in commercial human spaceflight, further progressing SpaceX’s reusability efforts. Booster B1094 will fly for its second time, landing at LZ-1. ‘Joy,’ a baby swan plush, will serve as the zero-g indicator.
