  NS-32 is a crewed suborbital flight carrying six private citizens—Aymette
  (Amy) Medina Jorge, Dr. Gretchen Green, Jaime Alemán, Jesse Williams, Mark
  Rocket, and Paul Jeris—to the edge of space onboard Blue Origin's New Shepard
  vehicle. Passengers briefly traveled above the Kármán Line onboard Blue
  Origin's reusable rocket, marking the 12th human spaceflight for the program
  and the 32nd New Shepard launch. The reusable BE-3PM engine and capsule
  emphasize Blue Origin's commitment to environmentally responsible, frequent
  suborbital missions.
