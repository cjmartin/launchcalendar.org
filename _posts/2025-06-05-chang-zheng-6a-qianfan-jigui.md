Chang Zheng 6A launched on June 5, 2025, deploying 18 G60/GuoWang LEO Group 4 constellation communications satellites from Taiyuan to polar orbit. These are part of Shanghai Spacecom’s ambitious low Earth orbit network, with plans for 1,296 satellites by 2027 and a long-term goal of 13,000 satellites. This launch supports China's plan to expand the GuoWang constellation and deliver global broadband internet, positioning China’s network as a major competitor to Starlink.
