Chang Zheng 6A launched on June 5, 2025, deploying 18 G60/GaoWang constellation communications satellites from Taiyuan. These are part of Shanghai Spacecom’s ambitious low Earth orbit network, with plans for 1,296 satellites by 2027 and a long-term goal of 13,000 satellites to deliver global broadband internet, positioning China’s GuoWang constellation as a competitor to Starlink.
