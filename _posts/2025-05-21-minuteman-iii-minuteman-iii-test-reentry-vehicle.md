The U.S. military conducted a test launch of an unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile on May 21, 2025, at 3:01 a.m. ET (0701 GMT) from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California. The missile sent a single reentry vehicle 4,200 miles to the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site in the Kwajalein Atoll, Marshall Islands. The launch, overseen by the Air Force Global Strike Command, was planned in advance to demonstrate the reliability and readiness of the United States' nuclear deterrent. The Minuteman III will be replaced by the LGM-35 Sentinel by 2030.
