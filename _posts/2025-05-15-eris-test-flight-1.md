  Gilmour Space Technologies' Eris Test Flight 1: the maiden orbital launch
  attempt by an Australian-made rocket from Australian soil, carrying a test
  payload for the company's micro-satellite bus to validate hybrid launch
  capabilities, gather data on the vehicle's three-stage hybrid-propulsion
  systems, and demonstrate the Eris rocket’s ability to reach orbit. The mission
  is Australia’s first sovereign commercial orbital launch attempt, lifting off
  from Bowen Orbital Spaceport.

  The maiden test flight of Gilmour Space Technologies' three-stage
  hybrid-propulsion Eris rocket, carrying a test payload for the company's
  micro-satellite bus to demonstrate orbital launch capability. This milestone
  mission marks Australia's first sovereign commercial orbital launch and the
  nation’s first attempt at an orbital hybrid-powered rocket flight. The flight
  aims to deliver the unnamed test payload to a sun-synchronous or low Earth
  orbit (LEO), qualifying rocket systems and hybrid propulsion technology, and
  gathering critical data for future missions.

Gilmour Space Technologies is preparing for the historic maiden launch of its Eris rocket—Australia's first sovereign-built vehicle to attempt an orbital mission—scheduled for May 15, 2025 at 21:30 UTC (May 16 local time) from the Eris Pad at Bowen Orbital Spaceport in North Queensland. After a short delay from May 14 to address a ground support issue, the Test Flight 1 mission will proceed, carrying a test payload for Gilmour Space's micro-satellite bus. The three-stage Eris rocket, a hybrid-propulsion vehicle with significant 3D-printed components, will attempt to reach a sun-synchronous or low Earth orbit (LEO), aiming to validate hybrid rocket orbital launch capabilities and rocket systems. This inaugural mission is a major milestone for the Australian space sector as its first domestically designed and manufactured commercial orbital rocket, marking Australia's entry into the club of sovereign orbital launch nations and gathering critical data for future launches. No livestream is planned, but launch video will be released after the attempt, and the rocket aims to deliver up to 215 kg to SSO.
