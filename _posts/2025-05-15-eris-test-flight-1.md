Gilmour Space Technologies is preparing for the maiden test flight of its Eris rocket, scheduled for no earlier than May 15, 2025, from the Eris Pad at Bowen Orbital Spaceport in North Queensland, Australia. This will be the first orbital launch attempt by an Australian-made rocket in over 50 years and marks a significant milestone for the country's space industry. The Eris TestFlight1 mission aims to demonstrate the capabilities of the Eris launch vehicle as Gilmour Space builds toward providing commercial and defense launch services from Australia. Weather conditions for the planned date are favorable, and the company will have fifty personnel in Bowen for the launch.
