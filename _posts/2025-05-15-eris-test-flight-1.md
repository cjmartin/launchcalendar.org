  Gilmour Space Technologies' Eris Test Flight 1: the maiden orbital launch
  attempt by an Australian-made rocket from Australian soil, carrying a
  demonstration payload (including symbolic Vegemite) for the company's
  micro-satellite bus to validate hybrid launch capabilities, gather data on the
  vehicle's three-stage hybrid-propulsion systems, and demonstrate the Eris
  rocket’s ability to reach orbit. The mission is Australia’s first sovereign
  commercial orbital launch attempt, lifting off from Bowen Orbital Spaceport.
  The initial attempt on May 15, 2025 was scrubbed due to a payload fairing
  issue, with a new launch to be scheduled after resolution.

  The maiden test flight of Gilmour Space Technologies' three-stage
  hybrid-propulsion Eris rocket, carrying a demonstration payload—featuring a
  symbolic Vegemite can—for the company's micro-satellite bus to demonstrate
  orbital launch capability. This milestone mission marks Australia's first
  sovereign commercial orbital launch and the nation’s first attempt at an
  orbital hybrid-powered rocket flight. The flight aims to deliver the unnamed
  test payload to a sun-synchronous or low Earth orbit (LEO), qualifying rocket
  systems and hybrid propulsion technology, and gathering critical data for
  future missions. The first launch attempt was scrubbed after a payload fairing
  issue was detected during final checks, with no damage to the rocket or pad.
  The launch will be rescheduled once the fairing anomaly is rectified.

Gilmour Space Technologies prepared for the historic maiden launch of its Eris rocket—Australia's first sovereign-built vehicle to attempt an orbital mission—scheduled for May 15, 2025 at 21:30 UTC (May 16 local time) from the Eris Pad at Bowen Orbital Spaceport in North Queensland. The launch, designated Test Flight 1, was scrubbed after a payload fairing anomaly was detected during final system checks, before the vehicle was fueled. No damage to the rocket or pad occurred. The three-stage Eris rocket, a hybrid-propulsion vehicle with significant 3D-printed components, was aiming to deliver a demonstration payload, including a symbolic Vegemite can, for Gilmour Space's micro-satellite bus to a sun-synchronous or low Earth orbit (LEO). This would qualify rocket systems and gather critical data for future launches. The inaugural mission represents a major milestone for the Australian space sector as its first domestically designed and manufactured commercial orbital rocket. No livestream was planned, but a launch video will be released after a future attempt. The new launch date will be set following resolution of the fairing issue.
