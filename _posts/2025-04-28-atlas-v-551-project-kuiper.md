description: >-
  Atlas V 551 launches Amazon's first major operational batch of Project Kuiper
  internet satellites, designated as the Kuiper 1 mission (KA01), from SLC-41 at
  Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. This mission marks Amazonâ€™s transition
  from prototypes to operational deployment for its broadband internet
  constellation, with a planned fleet of over 3,200 satellites in low Earth
  orbit. The launch is notable as the 250th Centaur upper stage mission and the
  first of more than 80 Kuiper launches across multiple providers, beginning
  with Atlas V's 'Bruiser' configuration with five solid boosters before future
  moves to Vulcan and others. The mission was previously delayed from earlier
  April due to weather and range constraints.

United Launch Alliance (ULA) is set to launch Amazon's first major operational batch of Project Kuiper broadband satellites (KA01 mission) on the Atlas V 551 rocket from SLC-41, Cape Canaveral, on April 28, 2025, at 23:00 UTC (7 p.m. EDT). The Kuiper 1 mission will deploy 27 satellites into low Earth orbit, marking the start of Amazon's full-scale constellation, which aims to grow to over 3,200 satellites across 80+ launches. The Atlas V flies in its 'Bruiser' five-solid-booster configuration and this is the 250th Centaur upper stage mission for ULA. The flight was delayed from earlier April due to weather and range constraints and is a pivotal step in building Amazon's global internet network, following two prototype launches in 2023.
