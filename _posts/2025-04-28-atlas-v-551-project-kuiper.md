  Amazon's first production launch of 27 Project Kuiper internet satellites,
  designated as the Kuiper 1 mission, will lift off aboard United Launch
  Alliance's Atlas V 551 rocket from SLC-41, Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.
  This marks the beginning of Amazon's operational deployment for its broadband
  internet constellation following two prototype launches in 2023. The launch is
  notable for being the 250th Centaur upper stage mission and initiates Amazonâ€™s
  planned series of Kuiper launches using multiple providers and rockets,
  starting with Atlas V before transitioning to Vulcan and others. The launch
  was delayed from earlier April dates due to weather and range availability.

United Launch Alliance (ULA) is scheduled to launch the first production batch of Amazon's Project Kuiper satellites on the Atlas V 551 rocket from SLC-41, Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, targeting April 28, 2025 at 23:00 UTC. The Kuiper 1 mission will place 27 satellites into low Earth orbit, marking the start of Amazon's operational broadband constellation following two prototype launches in 2023. Delayed from earlier April due to weather and range availability, this is the 250th Centaur upper stage mission and marks the beginning of a multi-provider, multi-rocket deployment effort. The weather forecast is 75% favorable for launch, and Amazon will use Atlas V before transitioning to Vulcan and other rockets for future missions.
