On April 28, 2025, ULA will launch Atlas V 551 from SLC-41 with 27 Amazon Kuiper broadband satellites to LEO, marking the start of the constellation's deployment. Amazon aims to provide global broadband via over 3,200 satellites. The mission is notable for being the 250th Centaur upper stage launch and part of a long-term contract for Kuiper launches across multiple rockets.
