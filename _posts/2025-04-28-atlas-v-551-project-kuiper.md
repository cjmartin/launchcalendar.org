  Amazon's first batch of 27 Project Kuiper internet satellites will launch as
  the Kuiper 1 mission aboard United Launch Alliance's Atlas V 551 rocket from
  SLC-41. The launch marks the start of operational deployment for Amazon's
  broadband constellation following prototype launches in 2023. The mission is
  notable for being the 250th Centaur upper stage launch and is part of Amazon's
  long-term contract using multiple launch providers. The launch was delayed
  from earlier April attempts due to weather and range availability.

Amazon's first 27 Project Kuiper internet satellites, part of a broadband internet constellation, are scheduled to launch atop a ULA Atlas V 551 rocket from SLC-41, Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, on April 28, 2025. The Kuiper 1 mission marks the first major operational deployment in Amazon's plan for a 3,200+ satellite constellation, following two prototype launches in 2023. The launch, delayed from earlier April attempts due to weather and range availability, is notable for being the 250th Centaur upper stage mission and begins Amazonâ€™s multi-rocket, long-term deployment effort.
