description: >-
  Atlas V 551 launches Amazon's first major operational batch of Project Kuiper
  broadband internet satellites, designated Kuiper 1 or KA-01, from SLC-41 at
  Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. This mission begins Amazon’s transition
  from prototypes to operational deployment, deploying 27 satellites as the
  first phase of a constellation planned to number over 3,200 in low Earth
  orbit, ultimately providing global broadband internet service and competing
  with SpaceX's Starlink. This flight marks the 250th Centaur upper stage
  mission and the first of over 80 scheduled Kuiper launches across multiple
  providers, including future flights on Vulcan, Blue Origin, SpaceX, and
  Arianespace. The Atlas V 551 'Bruiser' configuration, featuring five solid
  boosters and a single-engine Centaur, launches the satellites, which will be
  raised to their operational orbits after deployment. The launch had been
  delayed from earlier April due to weather and range constraints.

United Launch Alliance's Atlas V 551 launched Amazon's first major operational batch of 27 Project Kuiper broadband satellites from SLC-41, Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, on April 28, 2025, at 23:01 UTC. This Kuiper 1 mission marks the start of Amazon's full-scale deployment of a planned 3,200+ satellite constellation aimed at providing global internet coverage and competing with SpaceX's Starlink. The satellites will be elevated to their operational orbits after deployment. The Atlas V flew in its 'Bruiser' five-solid-booster configuration, marking the 250th Centaur upper stage mission for ULA. The launch, previously postponed due to weather and range issues, is a pivotal step toward Amazon’s global network. Future launches will use ULA’s Vulcan and other providers including Blue Origin, SpaceX, and Arianespace.
