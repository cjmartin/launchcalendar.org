Landspaceâ€™s methane-fueled ZhuQue-2E rocket is scheduled to launch from Site 96 at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center, China, on May 17, 2025 at 04:15 UTC. The payload has not been disclosed but is believed to be headed for Sun-synchronous orbit. This marks the fifth launch for the ZhuQue-2-series and continues ZhuQue-2E's distinction as the first methane-fueled orbital-class rocket to reach orbit. The mission will fly on a southwest trajectory carrying an unknown payload.
