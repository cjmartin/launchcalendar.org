  Landspace's ZhuQue-2E launched six Tianyi satellites—two optical remote
  sensing (Tianyi 29, 35), one SAR (Tianyi 42), and three space science
  experiment satellites (Tianyi 34, 45, 46)—for SpaceTY/Spacety into
  Sun-synchronous orbit from Jiuquan. The mission featured upgraded fairing and
  engines aboard ZhuQue-2E.

  Six Tianyi satellites by SpaceTY were launched: two optical remote sensing
  satellites (Tianyi 29, 35), one remote-sensing synthetic aperture radar
  satellite (Tianyi 42), and three space science experiment satellites (Tianyi
  34, 45, 46), all intended for Sun-synchronous orbit. The mission, operated by
  SpaceTY (Spacety), included a mix of technology demonstrators and SAR imaging
  payloads and further demonstrated ZhuQue-2E's upgraded, taller carbon fiber
  fairing and methalox engines.

On May 17, 2025, Landspace’s upgraded methane-fueled ZhuQue-2E rocket launched six Tianyi satellites into Sun-synchronous orbit from Site 96 at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center, China, at 04:12 UTC, following a delay from an initial scrub due to ground support issues. The payloads, operated by SpaceTY (Spacety), included two optical remote sensing satellites (Tianyi 29, 35), one synthetic aperture radar satellite (Tianyi 42), and three space science experiment satellites (Tianyi 34, 45, 46)—a mix of technology demonstrators and SAR satellites. This marks the fifth launch of the ZhuQue-2-series and featured an improved, taller carbon fiber fairing and upgraded engines.
