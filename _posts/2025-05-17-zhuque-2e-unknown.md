  Six Tianyi satellites by SpaceTY were launched: two optical remote sensing
  satellites (Tianyi 29, 35), one remote-sensing synthetic aperture radar
  satellite (Tianyi 42), and three space science experiment satellites (Tianyi
  34, 45, 46), all intended for Sun-synchronous orbit. The mission was carried
  out on Landspace's methane-fueled ZhuQue-2E rocket and marks the fifth launch
  of the ZhuQue-2-series.

On May 17, 2025, Landspace’s methane-fueled ZhuQue-2E rocket launched six Tianyi satellites into Sun-synchronous orbit from Site 96 at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center, China, at 04:12 UTC. The payloads, operated by SpaceTY (Spacety), included two optical remote sensing satellites (Tianyi 29, 35), one synthetic aperture radar satellite (Tianyi 42), and three space science experiment satellites (Tianyi 34, 45, 46). This marks the fifth launch of the ZhuQue-2-series, continuing ZhuQue-2E's distinction as the first methane-fueled orbital-class rocket to reach orbit in China, and further demonstrating ZhuQue-2E's new capabilities with its extended fairing and methalox engines.
