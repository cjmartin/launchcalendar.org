Landspace’s methane-fueled ZhuQue-2E rocket launched six Tianyi satellites into Sun-synchronous orbit from Site 96 at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center, China, on May 17, 2025 at 04:12 UTC. The payloads included three Earth observation and three technology demonstration satellites built by SpaceTY. This marks the fifth launch for the ZhuQue-2-series and continues ZhuQue-2E's distinction as the first methane-fueled orbital-class rocket to reach orbit in China. The rocket uses methane and oxygen propellants and is the first methane-fueled vehicle to reach orbit.
