On March 30, 2025, Isar Aerospace attempted the first orbital rocket launch from European soil with its Spectrum rocket at Norway's Andøya Spaceport. The maiden flight suffered an anomaly 18 seconds after liftoff, causing the rocket to tumble and crash back to Earth, where it exploded. No payloads were aboard; the flight was a test to collect vehicle data. The spaceport facilities remained unharmed, and Isar Aerospace continues to plan future commercial missions for Spectrum.
