The Starlink Group 15-3 mission is now scheduled to launch from SLC-4E, Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, on May 6, 2025, at 17:31 UTC, after an earlier scrub and delay from May 4. Using Falcon 9 booster B1081 for its 14th flight, SpaceX will deploy 26 Starlink V2 Mini satellites to a 70° inclined low Earth orbit. The booster will attempt a landing on the droneship 'Of Course I Still Love You'. The increased FAA permit for Falcon 9 launches at Vandenberg supports SpaceX’s rapid launch cadence.
