  SpaceX Falcon 9 will launch Starlink Group 15-3, carrying 26 Starlink V2 Mini
  satellites to a 70° inclination low Earth orbit from SLC-4E at Vandenberg
  Space Force Base. The mission, relevant for extending Starlink connectivity to
  underserved communities such as East Carroll Parish, Louisiana, uses Falcon 9
  booster B1081 on its 14th flight with a landing attempt on the 'Of Course I
  Still Love You' droneship. Launch was originally targeted for May 3, 2025,
  delayed due to heavy clouds, then scrubbed and rescheduled from May 4 to May 6

The Starlink Group 15-3 mission is now scheduled to launch from SLC-4E, Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, on May 6, 2025, at 17:31 UTC, following earlier scrubs and delays due to weather, including heavy cloud cover. Using Falcon 9 booster B1081 for its 14th flight, SpaceX will deploy 26 Starlink V2 Mini satellites to a 70° inclined low Earth orbit. The booster will attempt a landing on the droneship 'Of Course I Still Love You'. This launch supports SpaceX’s rapid launch cadence from Vandenberg under the increased FAA permit and is notable for extending Starlink coverage to underserved communities, such as East Carroll Parish, Louisiana. The launch will be webcast live by SpaceX and through other media outlets.
