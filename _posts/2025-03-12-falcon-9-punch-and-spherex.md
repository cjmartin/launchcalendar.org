NASA's PUNCH mission, consisting of four satellites to study the sun's corona and solar wind, launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, on March 12, 2025. The launch also carried NASA's SPHEREx space telescope, which will map the entire sky in infrared. The article discusses early imaging successes from PUNCH, including first light images revealing colorful details in zodiacal light and the corona. Images from the various instruments on PUNCH have provided valuable data in calibrating and validating the mission, with highlights on the capabilities and scientific goals of both PUNCH and SPHEREx.
