  SpaceX Falcon 9 launched the CRS-32 Cargo Dragon for its 32nd commercial
  resupply mission (CRS-32) to the International Space Station for NASA,
  delivering scientific experiments, food, water, spare parts, and the ACES
  atomic clock experiment. The mission produced a striking 'nebula-like' glow in
  the early morning sky as the Falcon 9's first stage performed a boostback burn
  during its return to a landing pad at Cape Canaveral, highlighting SpaceX's
  rapid launch cadence from LC-39A, Kennedy Space Center.
