description: >-
  SpaceX Falcon 9 launched the uncrewed CRS-32 Cargo Dragon mission—its 32nd
  commercial resupply flight—to the International Space Station for NASA from
  Pad 39A, Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral, Florida. The Cargo Dragon
  delivered over 3 tons (about 6,700 pounds) of supplies, food, water, and spare
  parts, as well as scientific experiments. These included refined free-floating
  robot maneuvers, atomic clocks for physics and relativity studies, and
  enhanced air quality monitoring systems, some intended for future lunar/Mars
  missions, along with the ACES atomic clock experiment and robotic
  demonstrations. The Falcon 9's first stage produced a striking 'nebula-like'
  glow in the early morning sky during its boostback burn and was successfully
  recovered at Landing Zone-1, Cape Canaveral. This mission marked the fifth
  flight for this particular Dragon capsule and the third for booster B1092,
  showcasing SpaceX's rapid flight cadence and precision in booster recoveries.
  CRS-32 highlighted the unique cargo return capability of the Dragon among
  active vehicles. The launch was streamed live by NASA and Space.com.

SpaceX launched its 32nd Commercial Resupply Services (CRS-32) mission to the International Space Station on April 21, 2025, at 08:15 UTC (4:15 a.m. EDT) using a Falcon 9 rocket and an uncrewed Cargo Dragon capsule from Pad 39A, Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral, Florida. The mission delivered over 3 tons (about 6,700 pounds) of cargo, including supplies, food, and a range of scientific experiments: refined free-floating robot maneuvers, two atomic clocks for physics and relativity research, and an enhanced air quality monitoring system for future lunar/Mars missions. The Dragon capsule, on its fifth flight, was boosted by B1092 (its third flight); the first stage produced a 'nebula-like' glow in the predawn sky during its boostback burn and was recovered at LZ-1. Dragon docked with the ISS on April 22 and is expected to remain for about a month before returning to Earth, providing unique cargo return capability among active ISS cargo vehicles. Northrop Grumman's next Cygnus mission was delayed due to spacecraft damage. The launch and science highlights were streamed live by NASA and Space.com.
