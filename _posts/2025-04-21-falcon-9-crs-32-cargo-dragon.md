description: >-
  SpaceX Falcon 9 launched the uncrewed CRS-32 Cargo Dragon mission—its 32nd
  commercial resupply flight—to the International Space Station for NASA from
  LC-39A, Kennedy Space Center, Florida. The Cargo Dragon delivered over 3 tons
  (about 6,700 pounds) of supplies, scientific experiments (including
  free-floating robot maneuvers, atomic clocks for relativity studies, enhanced
  air quality monitoring hardware, the ACES atomic clock experiment, hardware
  for air quality monitoring, and robotic demonstrations), food, water, and
  spare parts. The Falcon 9's first stage produced a striking 'nebula-like' glow
  in the early morning sky during its boostback burn and was successfully
  recovered at Landing Zone-1, Cape Canaveral. This mission marked the fifth
  flight for this particular Dragon capsule and the third for booster B1092,
  showcasing SpaceX's rapid flight cadence and precision in booster recoveries.
  The CRS Cargo Dragon is unique among current ISS cargo vehicles in its ability
  to return cargo safely to Earth. The launch was streamed live by NASA and
  Space.com.

SpaceX launched its 32nd Commercial Resupply Services (CRS-32) mission to the International Space Station on April 21, 2025, at 4:15 a.m. EDT (0815 GMT) using a Falcon 9 rocket and an uncrewed Cargo Dragon capsule from Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center, Florida. The mission delivered over 3 tons (about 6,700 pounds) of cargo, including food, equipment, new experiments such as free-floating robot maneuvers, atomic clocks for relativity studies, and enhanced air quality monitoring hardware. The Dragon capsule, flying its fifth mission, was boosted by B1092 on its third flight; the first stage was recovered at LZ-1, producing a 'nebula-like' glow in the pre-dawn sky during its boostback burn. Dragon docked with the ISS on April 22 and is expected to remain for about a month before returning to Earth, providing unique cargo return capability among active ISS cargo vehicles. The launch and science highlights were streamed live by NASA and Space.com.
