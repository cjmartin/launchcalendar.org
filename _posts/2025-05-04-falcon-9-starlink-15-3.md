SpaceX scheduled the Starlink Group 15-3 mission to launch 26 Starlink V2 Mini satellites on Falcon 9 booster B1081's 14th flight from SLC-4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base on May 4, 2025, at 17:59 UTC. The launch was scrubbed on May 3 and rescheduled for May 4, but has since been put on hold with no new date announced. The flight aims for a southeastern trajectory, targeting a droneship landing. The FAA recently increased Falcon 9's permitted annual launch frequency at Vandenberg, enabling SpaceX's rapid cadence.
