SpaceX is now targeting Sunday, May 4 at 10:59 a.m. PDT (17:59 UTC) for the launch of 26 Starlink V2 Mini satellites on the Starlink 15-3 mission, aboard a Falcon 9 rocket from SLC-4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base. The launch was scrubbed on Saturday and rescheduled for Sunday. Falcon 9 booster B1081, which previously supported missions like Crew-7 and CRS-29, will attempt landing on the droneship 'Of Course I Still Love You.' This mission highlights SpaceX's increasing launch cadence at Vandenberg, made possible by recent FAA approval enabling higher West Coast launch frequency.
