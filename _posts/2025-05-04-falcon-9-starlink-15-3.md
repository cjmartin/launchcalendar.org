SpaceX's third Falcon 9 launch of the month, scheduled to send 26 Starlink V2 Mini satellites into low Earth orbit from SLC-4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base, has been put on hold with no new launch date announced. The launch was originally targeted for May 4, 2025, at 17:59 UTC using booster B1081 on its 14th flight, aiming for a southeastern trajectory with a droneship landing. The FAA's recent acceptance of a new environmental assessment may allow for increased launch rates from SLC-4E, supporting SpaceX's rapid launch cadence.
