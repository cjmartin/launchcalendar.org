Starlink Group 15-3 is set to launch from SLC-4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base on May 4, 2025, at 17:59 UTC. The mission will use Falcon 9 booster B1081, making its 14th flight, to deliver 26 Starlink V2 Mini satellites to a 70° inclination low Earth orbit. The booster is expected to land on the 'Of Course I Still Love You' droneship. The launch was scrubbed on May 3 and rescheduled for May 4, highlighting SpaceX’s rapid launch cadence at Vandenberg enabled by higher FAA-approved launch frequency.
