  Tianwen-2 is China's second interplanetary mission and the country's first
  asteroid sample-return attempt. The spacecraft will target the near-Earth
  asteroid 469219 Kamo‘oalewa (2016 HO3), collecting and returning up to 1,000g
  of material to Earth by 2027 using both touch-and-go and anchor-drilling
  sampling techniques. After the sample return, Tianwen-2 will use Earth's
  gravity to continue to a flyby of comet 311P/PANSTARRS around 2035 for further
  studies. The mission aims to study the formation and evolution of asteroids
  and the early solar system and will demonstrate autonomous navigation,
  advanced sample acquisition, and new sampling techniques, carrying eight
  scientific instruments and a sample return capsule.

China successfully launched the Tianwen-2 mission aboard a Chang Zheng 3B/E (Long March 3B/E) rocket from Launch Complex 2 at Xichang Satellite Launch Center on May 28, 2025, at 17:31 UTC. This landmark mission—China's first asteroid sample-return and the 168th CZ-3B/E flight—will rendezvous with the near-Earth asteroid 469219 Kamo‘oalewa (2016 HO3), conduct close observations, and collect and return up to 1,000g of samples using touch-and-go and anchor-drilling methods by 2027. Following the sample return, the spacecraft will use Earth's gravity for a slingshot maneuver to reach comet 311P/PANSTARRS for a flyby around 2035. The mission is designed to study the formation and evolution of asteroids and the early solar system, carrying eight scientific instruments and a sample return capsule. CASC confirmed mission success soon after launch. This marks the first time the Long March 3B series has been used for a launch to escape Earth's orbit and highlights a significant step in China's planetary exploration program and international scientific collaboration.
