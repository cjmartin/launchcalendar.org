Tianwen-2, China's second interplanetary mission, is scheduled to launch no earlier than May 28, 2025, aboard a Chang Zheng 3B/E from Launch Complex 2 at Xichang Satellite Launch Center. The spacecraft will attempt to collect samples from the near-Earth asteroid 469219 Kamo‘oalewa using both touch-and-go and robotic anchor-drilling techniques, then return them to Earth. Afterward, it will continue to comet 311P/PANSTARRS for extended study, advancing Chinese technical and scientific prowess in deep-space missions.
