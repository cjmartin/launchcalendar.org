  China's Chang Zheng 3B/E will launch the Tianwen-2 asteroid sample return
  mission from Xichang. The spacecraft will collect and return samples from the
  near-Earth asteroid Kamo‘oalewa before continuing on to study comet
  311P/PANSTARRS.

payload-description: >-
  Tianwen-2 is China's second interplanetary mission. It is an asteroid
  sample-return spacecraft targeting the near-Earth asteroid 469219 Kamo‘oalewa
  (2016 HO3), aiming to collect and return over 100g of material to Earth by
  2027 using touch-and-go and anchor-drilling techniques. After sample return,
  Tianwen-2 will use Earth gravity to continue to a flyby of comet
  311P/PANSTARRS, around 2035, for further studies. The mission will demonstrate
  autonomous navigation, advanced sample acquisition, and test new sampling
  techniques, carrying eight scientific instruments and a sample return capsule.

China successfully launched the Tianwen-2 mission aboard a Chang Zheng 3B/E (Long March 3B/E) rocket from Launch Complex 2 at Xichang Satellite Launch Center on May 28, 2025, at 17:31 UTC. Tianwen-2 will rendezvous with the near-Earth asteroid 469219 Kamo‘oalewa (2016 HO3), conduct close observations, and collect and return over 100g of samples using touch-and-go and anchor-drilling methods by 2027. After returning the samples to Earth, the spacecraft will use Earth's gravity for a slingshot maneuver to reach comet 311P/PANSTARRS for a flyby around 2035. The mission tests new sampling methods, demonstrates advanced autonomous navigation, and carries eight scientific instruments and a sample return capsule. CASC confirmed mission success shortly after launch. This mission represents a significant step in China's planetary exploration program and scientific collaboration.
