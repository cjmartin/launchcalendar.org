  China's Chang Zheng 3B/E will launch the Tianwen-2 asteroid sample return
  mission from Xichang. The spacecraft will collect and return samples from the
  near-Earth asteroid Kamo‘oalewa before continuing on to study comet
  311P/PANSTARRS.

  Tianwen-2 is China's second interplanetary mission. The spacecraft is designed
  for a near-Earth asteroid sample return and comet exploration: its first goal
  is to collect and return samples from asteroid 469219 Kamo‘oalewa (2016 HO3)
  using touch-and-go and anchor-drilling techniques (with a goal of returning
  over 100g of material), then continue on to fly by and study comet
  311P/PANSTARRS after returning samples to Earth. The mission will demonstrate
  autonomous navigation and advanced sample acquisition, and carries eight
  scientific instruments and a sample return capsule.

Tianwen-2, China's second interplanetary mission, is scheduled to launch May 28, 2025, at 17:30 UTC aboard a Chang Zheng 3B/E from Launch Complex 2 at Xichang Satellite Launch Center. The spacecraft aims to collect and return over 100g of samples from the near-Earth asteroid 469219 Kamo‘oalewa (2016 HO3) using touch-and-go and anchor-drilling methods, then return them to Earth. Afterward, the mission will continue with an extended flyby to study comet 311P/PANSTARRS. Tianwen-2 will demonstrate advanced autonomous navigation and sample acquisition techniques, carries eight scientific instruments and a sample return capsule, and marks another advance in Chinese deep-space capabilities and international collaboration.
