A North Korean [Kwangmyongsong (Unha) carrier rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unha) launched the [Kwangmyŏngsŏng-4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwangmy%C5%8Fngs%C5%8Fng-4) earth observation satellite into geocentric low earth orbit. The launch was internationally condemned as a cover to test an intercontinental ballistic missile.
