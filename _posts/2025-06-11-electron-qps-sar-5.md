  The QPS-SAR-11 (Yamatsumi-1) is a small, high-performance synthetic aperture
  radar (SAR) Earth-observing satellite for Japanese company iQPS (Institute for
  Q-shu Pioneers of Space, Inc.), also referred to as YAMATSUMI-I. This
  satellite supports the expanding iQPS constellation to provide frequent,
  near-real-time, high-resolution radar imaging for global monitoring and rapid
  response services, capable of monitoring stationary and moving objects
  worldwide.

Rocket Lab successfully launched its 66th Electron rocket on June 11, 2025, deploying the QPS-SAR-11 satellite, also known as Yamatsumi-1 ('The Mountain God Guards'), for Japanese company iQPS at 15:31 UTC from LC-1A, Mahia, New Zealand. The mission placed the payload into a 575km Earth orbit, marking the eighth Electron mission of 2025 and Rocket Lab’s fourth overall for iQPS. The launch continues the partnership to deploy the iQPS synthetic aperture radar constellation, supporting more frequent global monitoring. Three more dedicated Electron launches for iQPS are planned for later in the year, with a goal of a 36-satellite constellation.
