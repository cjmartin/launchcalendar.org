  The QPS-SAR-11 (Yamatsumi-1) is a small, high-performance synthetic aperture
  radar (SAR) Earth-observing satellite for Japanese company iQPS (Institute for
  Q-shu Pioneers of Space, Inc.), also referred to as YAMATSUMI-I. This
  satellite is part of the growing iQPS constellation for frequent,
  high-resolution radar imaging of Earth and rapid response services, capable of
  monitoring stationary and moving objects worldwide.

Rocket Lab successfully launched its 66th Electron rocket on June 11, 2025, deploying the QPS-SAR-11 satellite, also known as Yamatsumi-1 ('The Mountain God Guards'), for Japanese company iQPS at 15:31 UTC from LC-1A, Mahia, New Zealand. The mission placed the payload into a 575km Earth orbit, marking the eighth Electron mission of 2025 and Rocket Lab’s fourth overall for iQPS. This launch supports iQPS's growing constellation targeting 36 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging satellites, enabling frequent, high-resolution global Earth monitoring. Three more dedicated Electron launches for iQPS are planned for later in the year.
