A Chinese [Long March 3C rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_March_3C) launched the [21st satellite](http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-02/01/c_135064994.htm) of the [BeiDou navigation system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeiDou_Navigation_Satellite_System) for the Chinese government.

China plans to launch [nearly 40 more satellites](http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-02/03/c_135072375.htm) for the BeiDou system over the next 5 years. Hopefully we'll be able to find more video coverage of these launches as they happen!
