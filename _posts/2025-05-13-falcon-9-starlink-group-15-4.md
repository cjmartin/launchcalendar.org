SpaceX has rescheduled the Falcon 9 launch of 26 Starlink Group 15-4 satellites to low Earth orbit for Monday, May 12, 2025 at 6:15 p.m. PT (01:15 UTC May 13) from SLC-4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base, California. The mission will deploy V2 Mini Optimized smallsats and further expand SpaceX's Starlink network. Backup launch opportunities were available until 7:08 p.m. PT, with further attempts possible on May 13. The Falcon 9 booster, making its sixth flight after supporting prior missions including NROL-126 and SPHEREx, will attempt landing on the 'Of Course I Still Love You' droneship in the Pacific Ocean. Residents may hear sonic booms in nearby counties during launch. Live coverage is available on SpaceX's X account, with additional information on SpaceX and Starlink websites.
