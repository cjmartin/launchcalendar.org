SpaceX is set to launch 26 Starlink Group 15-4 V2 Mini Optimized satellites into low Earth orbit on Monday, May 12, 2025, at 6:15 p.m. PDT (01:15 UTC on May 13) from SLC-4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base, California. The mission will use a Falcon 9 rocket, with a first stage booster making its sixth flight. The booster will attempt a landing on the 'Of Course I Still Love You' droneship stationed in the Pacific Ocean, and residents nearby may hear sonic booms depending on conditions. Backup opportunities are available later on Monday and on Tuesday, May 13. This launch will further expand the Starlink internet constellation, marking SpaceX's 18th California mission of 2025. Live webcast is available via SpaceX's X account and the X TV app.
