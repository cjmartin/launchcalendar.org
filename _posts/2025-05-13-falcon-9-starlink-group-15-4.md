SpaceX launched the Falcon 9 Starlink Group 15-4 mission from SLC-4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base on May 13, 2025 at 01:15 UTC (6:15 p.m. PDT, May 12). The launch deployed 26 Starlink satellites to low-Earth orbit using Falcon 9 booster B1088-6, which successfully landed on the 'Of Course I Still Love You' droneship. This marked the boosterâ€™s sixth flight after supporting missions such as NROL-126 and SPHEREx. It was the 56th Falcon 9 flight of 2025, with 39 dedicated to Starlink launches. Residents in the region may have heard sonic booms as the rocket launched. Coverage was available via official SpaceX channels and media outlets.
