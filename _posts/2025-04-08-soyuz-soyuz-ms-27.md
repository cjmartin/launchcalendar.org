A Russian Soyuz rocket will launch NASA astronaut Jonny Kim and Roscosmos cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky aboard the Soyuz MS-27 spacecraft from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, to the International Space Station on April 8, 2025 at 1:47 a.m. EDT (0557 GMT). The mission is crewed and the crew is set for about an eight-month stay aboard the ISS, joining Expeditions 72 and 73. Live coverage will be available from NASA and Space.com, with docking expected a few hours after launch. This will be the first spaceflight for Kim and Zubritsky and the third for Ryzhikov.
