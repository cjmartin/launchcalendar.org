  A Gen-3 Earth-observing satellite for BlackSky, designed to join their
  constellation and deliver very high-resolution imagery (up to 50 cm) with
  shortwave infrared sensors and AI-enabled analytics for daily intelligence
  operations. Providing rapid revisit and daily intelligence services for U.S.
  government and commercial customers, this was the second of four Gen-3
  launches for 2025. The satellite was deployed in a 470 km mid-inclination
  orbit, further expanding BlackSky's capabilities with high-resolution,
  AI-powered imaging in low Earth orbit.

Rocket Lab successfully launched the 'Full Stream Ahead' mission on June 2, 2025, at 23:57 UTC (7:57 p.m. ET), carrying BlackSky’s second Gen-3 Earth-observing satellite aboard an Electron rocket from its New Zealand site. Despite minor delays due to weather and additional system checks, the mission deployed the satellite into a 470 km mid-inclination low Earth orbit. This is the second of four planned Gen-3 launches for BlackSky this year, the 65th Electron flight, and Rocket Lab's 10th launch for BlackSky. Equipped with advanced sensors capable of 50 cm resolution and AI-driven analytics, the Gen-3 satellite enhances BlackSky’s rapid revisit and daily intelligence services for government and commercial customers, marking further growth for the constellation.
