SpaceX successfully launched the Starlink 12-17 mission on April 12, 2025, at 8:53 p.m. EDT (00:53 April 13 UTC) from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex-39A. The Falcon 9 rocket carried 21 Starlink satellites into low Earth orbit, 13 of which are equipped with Direct to Cell technology, promising to eliminate mobile dead zones. The rocket's first stage booster (B1083) landed on the droneship 'A Shortfall of Gravitas' in the Atlantic Ocean. This marks SpaceX's 42nd Falcon 9 mission of 2025 and adds to its growing Starlink megaconstellation. SpaceX has partnered with T-Mobile in the US for Direct to Cell service.
