NASA's Dragonfly mission, part of the New Frontiers program, is scheduled to launch atop a SpaceX Falcon Heavy in July 2028 bound for Saturn's moon Titan. The unique rotorcraft lander will touch down near Selk Crater, exploring Titan's organic chemistry, prebiotic processes, and surface features with a sophisticated suite of scientific instruments. Dragonfly seeks to investigate conditions that might be similar to those on early Earth, advancing our understanding of how life may arise and the potential habitability of environments beyond our planet.
