  EOS-09 (RISAT-1B) is a 1,710 kg C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) Earth
  observation satellite developed by ISRO. Designed for a five-year mission in a
  610 km Sun-synchronous orbit, EOS-09 would have provided all-weather,
  day-and-night imaging for reconnaissance, Earth monitoring, and security. The
  mission was lost due to a third stage failure on the PSLV-C61, which suffered
  a loss of chamber pressure and failed to place the satellite in its intended
  orbit.

On May 18, 2025, ISRO launched the EOS-09 (RISAT-1B) C-band SAR Earth observation and reconnaissance satellite aboard PSLV-XL (PSLV-C61) from the First Launch Pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre. The PSLV-C61 mission, intended to deliver the 1,710 kg satellite to a 610 km Sun-synchronous orbit for all-weather, day-and-night radar imaging, failed due to a loss of chamber pressure in the third stage approximately six minutes after launch, resulting in total mission loss. This marked only the third failure in PSLV's history and impacted India’s 2025 launch schedule. EOS-09 was designed to expand India’s advanced Earth observation and border monitoring capabilities. ISRO officials announced further updates would follow after analysis.
