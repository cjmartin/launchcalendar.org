  EOS-09 (RISAT-1B) is a 1,710 kg C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) Earth
  observation satellite developed by ISRO. Designed for a five-year mission in a
  610 km Sun-synchronous orbit, the satellite was equipped for all-weather,
  day-and-night observation and reconnaissance. The payload was intended for
  continuous remote-sensing and intelligence applications, especially regarding
  border security. The mission was lost due to a PSLV-C61 third stage failure
  approximately six minutes after launch, which caused loss of chamber pressure
  and prevented orbital insertion.

On May 18, 2025, ISRO launched the EOS-09 (RISAT-1B) C-band SAR Earth observation and reconnaissance satellite aboard PSLV-XL (PSLV-C61) from the First Launch Pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre. The PSLV-C61 mission, intended to deliver the 1,710 kg satellite carrying a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to a 610 km Sun-synchronous orbit for all-weather, day-and-night imaging, failed due to a loss of chamber pressure in the third stage approximately six minutes after launch, resulting in total mission loss. This was ISRO's second space mission in 2025 and the 101st orbital launch for the organization. The mission marked only the third failure in PSLV's history and impacted India's 2025 launch schedule. ISRO officials are investigating the anomaly and announced further updates would follow after analysis. The EOS-09 satellite was equipped to support operational applications in sectors such as intelligence and Indian border security.
