payload-description: >-
  EOS-09 (RISAT-1B) is a 1,710 kg C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) Earth
  observation satellite developed by ISRO. Designed for a 5-year mission in a
  610 km Sun-synchronous orbit, EOS-09 would have provided all-weather,
  day-and-night imaging for reconnaissance, Earth monitoring and security. The
  synthetic aperture radar enabled round-the-clock imaging through clouds and at
  night for operational and security monitoring. However, the PSLV-C61 mission
  failed to reach the intended orbit due to a third stage issue, resulting in a
  mission loss.

ISRO’s PSLV-XL rocket launched EOS-09 (RISAT-1B) from the First Launch Pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre on May 18, 2025, at 01:29 UTC. The PSLV-C61 mission, intended to deliver a 1,710 kg C-band SAR satellite for all-weather, day-and-night radar imaging for operational and security monitoring, failed due to a third stage issue approximately six minutes after launch, resulting in mission loss. This marked only the third failure in PSLV's history and was India’s second orbital launch of 2025. EOS-09 was planned to provide advanced Earth observation capabilities as part of India's expanding space program.
