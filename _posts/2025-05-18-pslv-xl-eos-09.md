  EOS-09 (RISAT-1B) is a 1,710 kg C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) Earth
  observation satellite developed by ISRO. Designed for a 5-year mission in a
  610 km Sun-synchronous orbit, EOS-09 would have provided all-weather,
  day-and-night imaging for reconnaissance, Earth monitoring and security.
  However, the PSLV-C61 mission failed to reach the intended orbit due to a
  third stage issue, resulting in a mission loss.

ISROâ€™s PSLV-XL rocket launched EOS-09 (RISAT-1B) from the First Launch Pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre on May 18, 2025, at 01:29 UTC. The C61 mission, intended to deliver a 1,710 kg C-band SAR satellite for Earth observation and reconnaissance to a 610 km sun-synchronous orbit, failed due to a third stage issue, resulting in mission loss. This was ISRO's second orbital launch of 2025. The satellite was meant to provide all-weather, day-and-night radar imaging for operational and security monitoring as part of India's expanding Earth observation program.
