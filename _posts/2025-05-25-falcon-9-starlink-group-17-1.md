On May 25, 2025 at 16:14 UTC, Falcon 9 will launch Starlink Group 17-1 from SLC-4E, Vandenberg SFB. This mission inaugurates a new polar shell for the Starlink constellation, placing satellites into Sun-synchronous orbit at 97-degree inclination. It is the first Starlink deployment to SSO (polar orbit) since Group 3. Booster recovery is planned on the 'Of Course I Still Love You' droneship.
