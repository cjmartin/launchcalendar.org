Axiom Mission 4 (Ax-4), the fourth private astronaut mission managed by Axiom Space, is now targeting launch at 12:46 UTC on June 9, 2025, from LC-39A at Kennedy Space Center, Florida. The mission, using Falcon 9 and Crew Dragon C213, will carry Commander Peggy Whitson, Pilot Shubhanshu Shukla, and Mission Specialists Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski and Tibor Kapu for a roughly two-week stay aboard the International Space Station. Over 60 scientific and technological experiments will be conducted, focusing on human health and technology demonstrations. The mission was delayed for Crew Dragon capsule readiness, including propulsion and environmental system preparations and a battery replacement. Booster B1094 will return to LZ-1 after launch. Axiom and NASA plan a mission overview news conference on May 20 to discuss additional details.
