  The GPS III SV08 satellite, also known as GPS 3 Space Vehicle 08 (SV-08) and
  nicknamed "Katherine Johnson," is a third-generation navigation satellite
  built by Lockheed Martin for the U.S. Space Force. It features advanced M-code
  military anti-jamming capabilities, improved accuracy, and increased
  resistance to jamming and spoofing. Named in honor of NASA mathematician
  Katherine Johnson, it is targeted for precise injection into Plane E Slot 3F
  of the GPS constellation and enables simultaneous system-wide updates,
  supporting the ongoing modernization of resilient global positioning services.

On May 30, 2025, SpaceX successfully launched the U.S. Space Force’s GPS III SV08 satellite, also known as GPS III-7 and "Katherine Johnson," aboard a Falcon 9 rocket from SLC-40, Cape Canaveral, at 17:37 UTC. The launch occurred during a 15-minute window amid a 45% chance of favorable weather. The advanced satellite, built by Lockheed Martin and named after NASA mathematician Katherine Johnson, is equipped with enhanced M-code technology, improving accuracy, resilience, and resistance to jamming and spoofing. The Falcon 9 booster B1092 landed successfully on 'A Shortfall of Gravitas.' This mission, completed on an accelerated three-month schedule after reassignment from ULA Vulcan, is part of ongoing efforts to bolster the GPS network against growing threats and enables simultaneous constellation-wide GPS system updates. It further highlights SpaceX’s rapid turnaround capability, contributing to the company’s 2025 record-setting launch cadence, and supports constellation modernization with two more GPS III satellites planned.
