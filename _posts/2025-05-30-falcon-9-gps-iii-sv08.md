  The GPS III SV08 satellite, also known as GPS 3 Space Vehicle 08 (SV-08), GPS
  III-7, and nicknamed "Katherine Johnson" or "Ms. Creola Katherine Johnson," is
  a third-generation navigation satellite built by Lockheed Martin for the U.S.
  Space Force. Equipped with advanced M-code military anti-jamming technology,
  the satellite provides more accurate and resilient Precision, Navigation, and
  Timing (PNT) capabilities, enabling simultaneous system-wide constellation
  updates and enhanced protection against jamming and spoofing. Named in honor
  of NASA mathematician Katherine Johnson, GPS III SV08 is part of ongoing
  efforts to modernize and enhance the resilience of the global GPS network.

On May 30, 2025, SpaceX successfully launched the U.S. Space Force’s GPS III SV08 satellite, also known as GPS III-7 and nicknamed "Ms. Creola Katherine Johnson," aboard a Falcon 9 rocket from SLC-40, Cape Canaveral, at 17:37 UTC. The expedited National Security Space Launch compressed integration and launch timelines to just three months, 40% faster than the previous rapid launch (RRT-1), highlighting SpaceX’s rapid turnaround capability and the U.S. Space Force's ability to accelerate critical missions. The advanced GPS III SV08 satellite, built by Lockheed Martin and named after NASA mathematician Katherine Johnson, features enhanced M-code technology, supporting improved accuracy, resilience, and resistance to jamming and spoofing. The Falcon 9 booster B1092 landed successfully on 'A Shortfall of Gravitas.' This mission advances modernization of the GPS constellation, bolstering U.S. navigation and timing services for military and civilian users and enabling simultaneous system-wide updates, with two more GPS III satellites to follow.
