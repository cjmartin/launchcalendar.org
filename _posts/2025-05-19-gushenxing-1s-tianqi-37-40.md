On May 19, 2025, Galactic Energy launched the Gushenxing-1S (Ceres-1S) rocket from offshore Chinese waters near Shandong Province, deploying four Tianqi IoT satellites (Tianqi 37-40) for Beijing-based Guodian Gaoke. The sea-launched, solid-fueled vehicle supported China's expanding IoT constellation. The launch, coordinated by the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center, marked Ceres-1's fifth sea launch and its twentieth flight overall, completing Guodian Gaoke's initial deployment plans for the Tianqi constellation, designed to provide global data service for internet-connected devices.
