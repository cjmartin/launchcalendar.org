On May 19, 2025, Galactic Energy launched the Gushenxing-1S (Ceres-1S) rocket from the Dong Fang Hang Tian Gang (Oriental Spaceport Launch Ship) near Rizhao, China, deploying four Tianqi IoT satellites (Tianqi 37-40) for Beijing-based Guodian Gaoke. The sea-launched, solid-fueled vehicle supported China's expanding IoT constellation and marked Ceres-1's fifth sea launch and twentieth flight overall. This flight advanced the coverage of Guodian Gaoke's large IoT satellite constellation, completing the initial deployment phase designed to provide global data services for internet-connected devices.
