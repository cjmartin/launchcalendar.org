United Launch Alliance's Atlas V 551 is set to launch Amazon's second batch of Project Kuiper internet satellites—Kuiper 2—on June 16, 2025, at 17:25 UTC (1:25 p.m. EDT) from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida. The mission will deliver 27 satellites to low Earth orbit, expanding Amazon's planned broadband mega-constellation of over 3,200 satellites to provide global high-speed internet. The launch was rescheduled after a weather delay. Kuiper 2 follows the successful Kuiper 1 launch, and is part of a multi-launch agreement between Amazon and ULA. The launch will be webcast and covered by industry media.
