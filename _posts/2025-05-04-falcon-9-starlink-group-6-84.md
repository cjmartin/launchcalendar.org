  On May 4, 2025, Falcon 9 launched a record 29 Starlink V2 Mini Optimized
  satellites (V2 Mini) to low Earth orbit from Kennedy Space Centre LC-39A. This
  set a new record for the largest batch of V2 Mini satellites on a single
  Starlink mission. The booster B1078 flew and landed successfully on 'A
  Shortfall of Gravitas' for its 20th flight. The mission targeted a 43-degree
  inclined, 530 km orbit, similar to other recent launches. Despite challenging
  weather, the launch was a success.

At 08:53 UTC on May 4, 2025 (Star Wars Day), SpaceX launched the Starlink Group 6-84 mission, sending a record 29 Starlink V2 Mini Optimized satellites to a 43-degree inclined, 530 km low Earth orbit from LC-39A at Kennedy Space Centre. The booster B1078 completed its 20th flight, landing successfully on the droneship 'A Shortfall of Gravitas.' The launch faced marginal weather conditions but proceeded without issue. This mission marked a new record for Starlink launches, with SpaceX approaching 8,500 Starlink satellites launched and over 7,300 operational. It was the 95th orbital launch of 2025 worldwide and SpaceX’s 53rd Falcon 9 launch of the year.
