Scheduled for May 4, 2025 at 08:53 UTC, SpaceX will launch the Starlink Group 6-84 mission using Falcon 9 booster B1078 from LC-39A, Kennedy Space Centre. The rocket will deliver 29 Starlink V2 Mini Optimized satellites to a low Earth orbit with a 43-degree inclination. The booster has a notable history including Crew-6 and USSF-124 missions. Weather conditions are 55% favorable with some cloud concerns, and the booster will land on the droneship 'A Shortfall of Gravitas.' This is the 95th global orbital launch and SpaceX’s 53rd Falcon 9 flight of 2025. Spaceflight Now and other sources will provide live coverage prior to launch.
