SpaceX is set to launch 29 Starlink V2 Mini Optimized satellites on the Starlink 6-84 mission using a Falcon 9 rocket from Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Centre. Liftoff is scheduled for Sunday, May 4, 2025, at 4:53 a.m. EDT (08:53 UTC). The booster for this mission, B1078, has previously supported flights including NASA Crew-6, USSF-124, Bluebird 1-5, and 15 other Starlink batches. Weather conditions are moderately favorable with some cloud concerns, and the booster will attempt to land on the droneship 'A Shortfall of Gravitas.' This Falcon 9 mission marks the 95th global orbital launch of 2025 and SpaceX's 53rd Falcon 9 flight of the year. Spaceflight Now will provide live coverage prior to launch.
