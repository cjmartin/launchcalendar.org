On May 27, 2025, at 16:57 UTC, SpaceX's Falcon 9 launched 24 Starlink satellites as Group 17-1 from SLC-4E, Vandenberg SFB. This mission inaugurates a new polar shell for the Starlink constellation, placing satellites into Sun-synchronous orbit at 97-degree inclinationâ€”the first Starlink deployment to SSO (polar orbit) since Group 3. Falcon 9 booster B1082 made its 13th flight and landed on the 'Of Course I Still Love You' droneship. This launch continues SpaceX's trend of booster reuse, expands the constellation's global coverage, and marked SpaceX's 63rd Falcon 9 flight of 2025.
