  A batch of 26 Starlink v2 Mini broadband internet satellites for SpaceX's
  global constellation was launched to low-Earth orbit aboard Falcon 9. The
  mission further expanded SpaceX's coverage with booster B1093 flying for the
  second time and landing successfully on 'Of Course I Still Love You' (OCISLY)
  droneship after a nearby wildfire at the launch site. The satellites were
  deployed 62.5 minutes after liftoff, and sonic booms were possible in nearby
  areas.

On May 16, 2025, at 6:43 a.m. PDT (13:43 UTC), SpaceX successfully launched the Starlink Group 15-5 mission, delivering 26 Starlink v2 Mini satellites to low Earth orbit from SLC-4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base, California. The first stage booster B1093, making its second flight, was recovered on the 'Of Course I Still Love You' droneship in the Pacific. The mission marked SpaceX's 59th Falcon 9 flight of the year and the 20th orbital launch from California in 2025, surpassing 1,000 Starlink satellites launched for the year. Satellite deployment occurred 62.5 minutes after liftoff. Nearby residents were alerted to possible sonic booms, and backup windows for launch were available that weekend. A nearby wildfire did not impact the launch.
