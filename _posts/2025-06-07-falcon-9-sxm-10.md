SiriusXM's SXM-10 satellite, built by Maxar Technologies, is launching on Falcon 9 at 03:00 UTC on June 7 from SLC-40, Cape Canaveral. The 6,000+ kg satellite will replace aging XM3 and XM4 in the SiriusXM constellation to serve over 33 million subscribers. The booster will land downrange on a SpaceX droneship in the Atlantic.
