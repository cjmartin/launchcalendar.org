  SiriusXM's SXM-10 is a third-generation high-powered digital audio radio
  satellite, built by Maxar Technologies on the 1300-class bus. The spacecraft
  is equipped with an L3Harris S-band antenna and features a large, unfurlable
  mesh reflector nearly 10 meters in diameter, enabling delivery of digital
  radio service—including to moving vehicles. With a mass of about 6,400 kg
  (14,100 pounds), SXM-10 will replace XM3 and XM4, joining SiriusXM's
  constellation and serving more than 33 million subscribers. It was deployed
  into geosynchronous transfer orbit and is designed to reinforce SiriusXM's
  broadcasting capabilities across North America.

SpaceX launched the SXM-10 communications satellite for SiriusXM on June 7, 2025, at 12:54 a.m. EDT (0454 UTC) from SLC-40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, using a Falcon 9 rocket. The booster (B1085), flying its eighth mission, successfully landed on the droneship 'A Shortfall of Gravitas.' The 14,100-pound (6,400 kg) SXM-10 satellite, manufactured by Maxar Technologies and based on the 1300-class bus, features a large unfurlable L3Harris S-band reflector and will replace XM3 and XM4, serving over 33 million digital radio subscribers in North America—including to moving vehicles. SpaceX confirmed successful deployment into geosynchronous transfer orbit about 33 minutes after launch. This was SpaceX's second SiriusXM launch in six months and marked their 69th Falcon 9 flight of 2025. SiriusXM continues expanding its fleet with SXM-11 and SXM-12 planned for the future. A live webcast is available via SpaceX's X (formerly Twitter) account.
