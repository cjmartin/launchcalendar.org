SpaceX will launch SiriusXM's SXM-10 satellite on a Falcon 9 from SLC-40, Cape Canaveral, at 03:19 UTC on June 7, 2025 (Friday, June 6, 11:19 p.m. ET). SXM-10, built by Maxar on the 1300-class bus and equipped with a large unfurlable L3Harris S-band reflector, will replace XM3 and XM4 to serve over 33 million digital radio subscribers in North America—including to moving vehicles. The Falcon 9 booster, flying its eighth mission, will attempt a landing on the droneship 'A Shortfall of Gravitas.' The mission cost is $69.75 million. SiriusXM continues expanding its fleet with SXM-11 and SXM-12 planned for the future. A live webcast will be available via SpaceX's X (formerly Twitter) account and X TV app.
