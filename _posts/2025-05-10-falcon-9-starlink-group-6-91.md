On Saturday, May 10, 2025, at 2:28 a.m. ET, SpaceX launched the 250th Falcon 9 mission from SLC-40, carrying 28 Starlink v2 Mini small satellites to low Earth orbit as part of the Group 6-91 mission. Booster B1083 completed its 11th flight, landing on 'A Shortfall of Gravitas.' The launch featured the first fairing to reach 30 flights and contributed to a constellation of over 7,300 Starlink satellites in orbit. Satellites were deployed about 65 minutes after launch, despite challenging 55% launch weather odds, further underscoring ongoing milestones in reusability and the continuing expansion of the Starlink internet network.
