On May 10, 2025, at 06:28 UTC, Falcon 9 launched 28 Starlink v2 Mini satellites for the Starlink Group 6-91 mission from SLC-40, Cape Canaveral. This flight marked the pad's 250th Falcon mission and SpaceX's 38th Starlink launch of the year, as well as the deployment of the 900th Starlink satellite of 2025. Booster B1083 executed its 11th flight, successfully landing on the droneship 'A Shortfall of Gravitas.' Despite only a 55% chance of favorable weather, SpaceX completed the mission, achieving further milestones for Falcon 9 reusability and increased fairing reuse.
