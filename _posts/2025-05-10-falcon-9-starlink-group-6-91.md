On May 10, 2025 at 2:28 a.m. ET (06:28 UTC), SpaceX completed its 250th Falcon 9 launch from SLC-40, delivering 28 Starlink v2 Mini satellites to low Earth orbit as part of the Group 6-91 mission. Booster B1083 made its 11th flight, landing on 'A Shortfall of Gravitas,' and the fairing achieved its 30th flight milestone. This was the 78th Starlink launch to the Group 6 shell, increasing the constellation to over 7,300 satellites. Despite 55% launch weather odds, satellites were deployed about 65 minutes after launch, demonstrating ongoing Falcon 9 reusability and further expanding the Starlink internet network.
