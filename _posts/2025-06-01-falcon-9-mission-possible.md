The Exploration Company has shipped its Mission Possible capsule—a subscale demonstrator for its modular Nyx spacecraft—to California ahead of its planned launch aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 on the Transporter-14 rideshare mission. The liftoff is expected no earlier than June 2025. Mission Possible will serve as The Exploration Company's first commercial mission, carrying small customer payloads. After launch, the capsule will remain attached to the Falcon 9 upper stage until after the deorbit burn, as it cannot independently deorbit. If successful, the mission will validate hardware and operational procedures ahead of future, larger Nyx variants, including eventual human spaceflight. The company acknowledges technical challenges and possible mission failure, but is working to maximize chances of success.
