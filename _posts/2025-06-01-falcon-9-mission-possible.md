The Exploration Company has shipped its Mission Possible capsule to California for launch on the SpaceX Falcon 9 Transporter-14 rideshare mission, targeted for June 2025. Mission Possible is a 2.5-meter subscale demonstrator for the Nyx modular spacecraft and marks the company's first commercial mission, carrying small customer payloads. Once in space, the capsule will remain attached to the Falcon 9 upper stage through deorbit, after which it will begin atmospheric reentry. The capsule lacks independent deorbit propulsion. The mission aims to validate hardware and operational procedures for future, larger Nyx variants, with the company acknowledging inherent risks while maximizing the chances for success.
