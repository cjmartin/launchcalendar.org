Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket is set to launch the NS-31 mission on April 14, 2025, at 9:30 a.m. EDT (1330 GMT) from Launch Site One in West Texas. The flight features a historic all-female crew: Lauren S√°nchez, Katy Perry, Amanda Nguyen, Aisha Bowe, Kerianne Flynn, and Gayle King. The suborbital mission will take them above the K√°rm√°n line for several minutes of weightlessness before returning to Earth. The launch will be livestreamed on Blue Origin's website, Space.com, and YouTube. The mission continues Blue Origin's space tourism flights and marks the first such launch with an all-woman crew.
