The U.S. Army conducted a hypersonic missile launch, likely the newly named 'Dark Eagle' Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW), from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on April 25, 2025. The event was not widely publicized, but confirmed via airspace closure notices and observation by photographers. The LRHW is a highly advanced two-stage surface-to-surface missile featuring a hypersonic glide body. The launch vehicle was seen to stage during ascentâ€”consistent with its two-stage configuration. The mission aligns with the ongoing development and operational testing of hypersonic capabilities by the U.S. Army.
