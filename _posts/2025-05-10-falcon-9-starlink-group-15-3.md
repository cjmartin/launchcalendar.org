  Falcon 9 will launch 26 Starlink v2 Mini satellites (Starlink Group 15-3),
  likely including Direct-to-Cell variants, into a 70-degree inclined orbit from
  SLC-4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base. Booster B1081 will fly for its 14th
  mission and target a droneship landing on Of Course I Still Love You. The
  mission, originally scheduled for early May, experienced delays due to weather
  and operational factors before being rescheduled, and continues SpaceXâ€™s
  regular Starlink launch cadence from the West Coast.

Originally delayed due to weather, Starlink Group 15-3 will launch from SLC-4E at Vandenberg on May 10, 2025 at 00:01 UTC. Carrying 26 Starlink v2 Mini satellites (likely mixed with Direct-to-Cell variants) to a 70-degree orbit, Falcon 9 booster B1081 will fly for its 14th time and target a landing on the droneship 'Of Course I Still Love You' in the Pacific. This continues SpaceX's regular Starlink deployment cadence from the West Coast following recent FAA approvals. The mission supports ongoing expansion of the Starlink satellite constellation and experienced weather and operational delays before being rescheduled. Media and SpaceX webcast coverage are available.
