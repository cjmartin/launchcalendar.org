description: >-
  Falcon 9 launched 26 Starlink v2 Mini satellites (Starlink Group 15-3), likely
  including Direct-to-Cell variants, into a 70-degree inclined orbit from SLC-4E
  at Vandenberg Space Force Base. Booster B1081 flew for its 14th mission and
  successfully landed on the droneship 'Of Course I Still Love You.' The
  mission, originally scheduled for early May, experienced several delays due to
  weather and operational factors before launching on May 10, 2025 at 00:19 UTC.
  This continues SpaceXâ€™s regular Starlink launch cadence from the West Coast,
  supporting expansion of the Starlink constellation.

SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 rocket carrying 26 Starlink v2 Mini satellites on the Starlink Group 15-3 mission from SLC-4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base on May 9, 2025 at 5:19 p.m. PDT (0019 UTC on May 10). The booster B1081 flew its 14th mission and successfully landed on the droneship 'Of Course I Still Love You.' The launch had been delayed several times due to weather and operational reasons, before FAA approval enabled a higher launch cadence from SLC-4E. This mission supports the ongoing expansion of the Starlink constellation with both standard and Direct-to-Cell variants for global broadband coverage. Media and SpaceX webcast coverage are available.
