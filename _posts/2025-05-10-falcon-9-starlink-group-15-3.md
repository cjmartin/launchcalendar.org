SpaceX's Starlink Group 15-3 mission, carrying 26 Starlink v2 Mini smallsats, is now scheduled to launch on May 10, 2025 from SLC-4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base after weather and operational delays. Booster B1081 is set for its 14th flight and a droneship landing. The launch supports expansion of the Starlink constellation, which increasingly serves underserved areas and may include Direct-to-Cell variants. The mission was temporarily off launch manifests before being rescheduled, and final timings remain subject to weather and operational changes. Media and SpaceX will provide webcast coverage.
