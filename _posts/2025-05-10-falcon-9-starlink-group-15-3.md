  SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 rocket with 26 Starlink v2 Mini satellites
  (Starlink Group 15-3), possibly including Direct-to-Cell variants, to a
  70-degree inclined orbit from SLC-4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base,
  California. Booster B1081 completed its 14th flight with a successful landing
  on the droneship 'Of Course I Still Love You', following delays caused by
  weather and operations. This flight expands the Starlink network and is part
  of SpaceX's increased activity from Vandenberg enabled by recent regulatory
  changes.

  SpaceX launched 26 Starlink v2 Mini satellites, including a mix of standard v2
  Mini and Direct-to-Cell variants, for Starlink Group 15-3 to low Earth orbit.
  The Vandenberg mission targeted a 70-degree inclination and further expands
  the growing Starlink broadband constellation. This launch was enabled by
  recent regulatory approvals for increased launch cadence at Vandenberg SFB.
