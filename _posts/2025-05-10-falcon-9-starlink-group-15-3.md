  Falcon 9 will launch 26 Starlink v2 Mini smallsats, potentially mixed with
  Direct-to-Cell variants, into a 70-degree inclined orbit from SLC-4E at
  Vandenberg Space Force Base. Booster B1081 will fly for its 14th mission, with
  a planned droneship landing on Of Course I Still Love You. The mission,
  originally scheduled for early May, was delayed due to weather and operational
  factors before being rescheduled.

The Starlink Group 15-3 mission is scheduled to launch from SLC-4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base on May 10, 2025 at 00:01 UTC (5:01 PM PDT, May 9 local). 26 Starlink v2 Mini satellites, potentially featuring a mix of standard and Direct-to-Cell variants, will be delivered to a 70-degree inclined orbit. Booster B1081, on its 14th flight, will attempt a landing on the droneship Of Course I Still Love You. The launch supports the ongoing expansion of the Starlink constellationâ€”aiding connectivity in underserved areas. The mission experienced delays due to weather and operational considerations and was temporarily off launch manifests before being rescheduled. Recent launches from Vandenberg have included mixed payload configurations to support different Starlink orbital shells. Media and SpaceX will provide webcast coverage.
