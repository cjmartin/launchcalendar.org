  SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 rocket with 26 Starlink v2 Mini satellites
  (Starlink Group 15-3), including Direct-to-Cell variants, to a 70-degree
  inclined orbit from SLC-4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base, California. Booster
  B1081 completed its 14th flight with a successful landing on the droneship 'Of
  Course I Still Love You', following several weather and operational delays.
  This mission adds to the growing Starlink constellation and is part of
  SpaceX's expanding launch activities from Vandenberg, enabled by recent
  regulatory approvals for more frequent launches.

  SpaceX launched 26 Starlink v2 Mini satellites for Starlink Group 15-3 to low
  Earth orbit. The Vandenberg mission included both standard v2 Mini and
  Direct-to-Cell variants for SpaceX's growing broadband constellation in a
  70-degree inclination orbit, further expanding the Starlink network. This
  launch reflects the increased cadence at Vandenberg supported by new FAA
  approvals for more frequent launches.

Delayed by weather and operational factors, SpaceX successfully launched 26 Starlink v2 Mini satellites (Group 15-3), including standard and Direct-to-Cell variants, aboard a Falcon 9 rocket from SLC-4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, at 00:19 UTC on May 10, 2025. The mission placed the satellites into a 70-degree inclined orbit. Booster B1081 completed its 14th flight, landing on 'Of Course I Still Love You.' This marked the 128th landing on that droneship and SpaceX's 54th Falcon 9 flight in 2025, reflecting a higher launch rate enabled by the recent FAA approvals for up to 50 launches per year from the pad.
