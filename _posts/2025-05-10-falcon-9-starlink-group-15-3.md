Delayed by weather, Starlink Group 15-3 is scheduled for May 10, 2025 from Vandenberg's SLC-4E. The mission will place 26 Starlink v2 Mini satellites—possibly including Direct-to-Cell variants—into a 70° inclined orbit, using Falcon 9 booster B1081 on its 14th flight and landing on the droneship 'Of Course I Still Love You.' This launch expands Starlink's coverage, especially for underserved communities such as East Carroll Parish, Louisiana, with support from SpaceX's increased FAA permit at Vandenberg. Previous missions have mixed satellite types per launch. Webcast coverage will be provided by SpaceX and media outlets.
