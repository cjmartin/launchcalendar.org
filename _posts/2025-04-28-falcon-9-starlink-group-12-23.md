On April 27, 2025, SpaceX successfully launched a Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral's SLC-40, carrying 23 Starlink satellites, 13 of which are capable of direct-to-cell phone service. Liftoff occurred at 10:09 p.m. EDT (0209 UTC). The booster, on its 20th flight, landed on the 'Just Read the Instructions' droneship after launch, and deployment of the satellites was confirmed about an hour later. This was SpaceXâ€™s 48th Falcon 9 mission of 2025. The launch continued the rapid deployment of Starlink v2-Mini satellites, further expanding the Starlink broadband constellation.
