description: >-
  SpaceX Falcon 9 launched 23 Starlink satellites—including v2 Mini and 13 with
  direct-to-cell capability—on the Starlink Group 12-10 mission from Launch
  Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center. This was SpaceX's second Starlink launch
  of the day as part of its rapid launch cadence, delivering satellites into
  low-Earth orbit inclined at 43 degrees to further expand the Starlink
  broadband constellation. The mission featured a new Falcon 9 booster, widely
  believed to be B1094, which landed safely on the droneship 'A Shortfall of
  Gravitas.' This was the 50th Falcon 9 launch of the year, and contributed to a
  record-setting period that included multiple launches within hours of each
  other.

On April 29, 2025 at 02:34 UTC, SpaceX launched the Starlink Group 12-10 mission using a brand-new Falcon 9 rocket from Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center. The mission delivered 23 Starlink satellites—including v2 Mini and 13 with Direct-to-Cell capability—into a low-Earth orbit inclined at 43 degrees. The booster, believed to be B1094, made a successful droneship landing on 'A Shortfall of Gravitas.' This marked SpaceX's 50th Falcon 9 launch of the year, with rapid successive launches including another Starlink mission just hours earlier. Of the 50 Falcon 9 flights in 2025, 33 supported Starlink launches. Weather conditions were generally favorable, with only minor concerns regarding clouds.
