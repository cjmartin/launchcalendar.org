  direct-to-cell capability—on the Starlink Group 12-10 mission from Launch
  Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center. Booster B1094 flew this mission on its
  maiden flight, landing successfully on the droneship 'A Shortfall of
  Gravitas.' This was SpaceX's second Starlink launch of the day, marking the
  company's 50th Falcon 9 launch of the year and further expanding the Starlink
