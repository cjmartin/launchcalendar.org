SpaceX launched the 23 Starlink satellites for the Starlink 12-10 mission on April 28, 2025, from Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center. This was the 50th Falcon 9 launch of the year and completed just six hours after a previous Starlink mission from Vandenberg. The launch featured a new booster, which safely landed on the droneship 'A Shortfall of Gravitas,' marking SpaceX's 439th booster landing overall. The weather was favorable at launch, with only minor cloud-related concerns noted.
