description: >-
  SpaceX launched the Starlink Group 12-10 mission carrying a mix of v2 Mini and
  Direct-to-Cell satellites to LEO. This was SpaceX's second Starlink launch of
  the day as part of its rapid launch cadence, delivering satellites into
  low-Earth orbit inclined at 43 degrees to further expand the Starlink
  broadband constellation. The mission featured the maiden flight of Falcon 9
  booster B1094, which landed safely on the droneship 'A Shortfall of Gravitas.'
  This marked the 50th Falcon 9 launch of 2025 during a record-setting period of
  frequent launches.

SpaceX launched the Starlink Group 12-10 mission on April 29, 2025 at 02:34 UTC from LC-39A, Kennedy Space Center. The flight carried v2 Mini and 13 Direct-to-Cell Starlink satellites to low-Earth orbit inclined at 43 degrees, using Falcon 9 booster B1094 on its maiden flight. The booster successfully landed on the droneship 'A Shortfall of Gravitas.' This mission marked the 50th Falcon 9 launch of the year, with 33 supporting Starlink launches. SpaceX continues to maintain a rapid cadence of launches, with multiple Starlink missions taking place within hours of each other as the company rapidly expands its satellite internet network. Weather conditions were generally favorable, with only minor concerns regarding clouds.
