  SpaceX Falcon 9 launched Starlink Group 12-10—23 Starlink satellites,
  including v2 Mini and 13 with Direct-to-Cell capability—from Launch Complex
  39A at Kennedy Space Center. The mission delivered the satellites into
  low-Earth orbit inclined at 43 degrees, using a new Falcon 9 booster (believed
  to be B1094) that landed successfully on 'A Shortfall of Gravitas.' This was
  SpaceX's 50th Falcon 9 launch of the year, part of a rapid launch cadence
  contributing to a Starlink total surpassing 7,260 satellites in orbit.

On April 29, 2025, SpaceX launched Starlink Group 12-10 atop a Falcon 9 rocket from Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center. The mission delivered 23 Starlink satellites—including v2 Mini and 13 with Direct-to-Cell capability—into low-Earth orbit inclined at 43 degrees, increasing the total number of Starlink satellites in orbit to more than 7,260. The booster, believed to be B1094 on its maiden flight, landed on 'A Shortfall of Gravitas.' This marked SpaceX's 50th Falcon 9 launch of the year, reflecting the company's rapid launch cadence with several launches in quick succession.
