On April 28, 2025, a brand-new SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket successfully launched 23 Starlink broadband satellites, including 13 with direct-to-cell capability, from Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center at 10:34 p.m. EDT (2:34 UTC April 29). This was the 50th Falcon 9 launch of the year, following another Starlink mission completed just six hours prior from Vandenberg. The Falcon 9 booster, on its first flight, landed on the droneship 'A Shortfall of Gravitas,' marking SpaceX's 439th booster landing overall. Of the 50 Falcon 9 launches in 2025, 33 were dedicated to Starlink. Weather conditions at launch were favorable, with minor concerns related to clouds.
