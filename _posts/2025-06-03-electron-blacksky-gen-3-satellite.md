Rocket Lab will launch the 'Full Stream Ahead' mission on June 2, 2025 EDT (June 3, 2025 01:15 UTC), carrying the BlackSky Gen-3 Earth-observing satellite aboard an Electron rocket from its New Zealand site. This marks the second in a series of four Electron launches for BlackSky's Gen-3 constellation in 2025 and the 65th overall flight for Electron. The mission will deliver the Gen-3 satellite to a circular low Earth orbit at 470 km altitude, augmenting BlackSkyâ€™s high-resolution imagery and AI-driven analytics constellation. The launch will be streamed live by Rocket Lab.
