description: >-
  Firefly Aerospace's Alpha rocket (FLTA006) will launch the Lockheed Martin
  LM400 Technology Demonstration (Tech Demo) satellite on the 'Message in a
  Booster' mission from Space Launch Complex 2 West (SLC-2W), Vandenberg Space
  Force Base, California. This tech demonstration for Lockheed Martin is part of
  a multi-launch deal to validate the flexible LM400 satellite platform,
  designed for commercial, civil, and military applications such as remote
  sensing and communications. Following delays due to weather and range
  restrictions, the mission is set to demonstrate the satellite's platform
  during a roughly 30-day low Earth orbit mission, with a controlled de-orbit at
  the end. Payload separation will occur about 12 minutes post-launch, after
  ascent powered by Alpha's four Reaver engines. This is the first Alpha flight
  of 2025, with more launches planned as Firefly expands rapid launch services.

Firefly Aerospace is set to launch its sixth Alpha rocket (FLTA006), carrying Lockheed Martin's LM400 Technology Demonstration (Tech Demo) satellite on the 'Message in a Booster' mission. The launch, after delays due to weather and range restrictions, is now scheduled for April 28, 2025, at 13:37 UTC from Space Launch Complex 2 West at Vandenberg Space Force Base. The mission serves as a technology demonstration for Lockheed Martinâ€™s LM400 satellite bus, part of a multi-launch agreement for up to 25 Alpha flights, and aims to validate the flexible satellite platform for commercial, civil, and military applications such as remote sensing and communications. The LM400 was encapsulated in March and is expected to demonstrate its capabilities over approximately 30 days in low Earth orbit before performing a controlled de-orbit. Payload separation will occur about 12 minutes after launch following ascent powered by Alpha's four Reaver engines. This partnership between Firefly and Lockheed expands rapid launch opportunities for government and commercial customers, with more Alpha launches planned throughout 2025.
