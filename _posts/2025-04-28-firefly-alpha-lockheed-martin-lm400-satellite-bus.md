  Firefly Alpha FLTA006 launches the Lockheed Martin LM400 satellite bus on the
  Message In A Booster mission to polar orbit. This tech demonstration for
  Lockheed Martin is part of a multi-launch deal to validate the flexible LM400
  satellite platform, designed for commercial, civil, and military applications
  such as remote sensing and communications. Firefly Alpha's four Reaver engines
  will propel the vehicle, with payload separation occurring about 12 minutes
  post-launch. This is the first Alpha flight of 2025, with more launches
  planned throughout the year.

Firefly Aerospace is set to launch its Alpha FLTA006 'Message In A Booster' mission from SLC-2W at Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, on April 28, 2025, at 13:37 UTC. The demonstration mission for Lockheed Martin aims to validate the LM400 satellite bus, a flexible platform intended for commercial, civil, and military applications such as remote sensing and communications. This flight marks the first of up to 25 missions in a multi-launch agreement between Firefly and Lockheed Martin. LM400 on this mission carries a communications payload and will separate approximately 12 minutes after launch, following ascent powered by Alpha's four Reaver engines. This launch is the first Alpha mission in 2025, with more planned for the year as Firefly expands its launch services.
