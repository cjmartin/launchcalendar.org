payload-description: >-
  QPS-SAR-10 (WADATSUMI-I) is a Japanese commercial synthetic aperture radar
  (SAR) Earth imaging satellite for iQPS. As the 10th in the QPS constellation,
  it is capable of high-resolution, all-weather, day-night Earth observation,
  delivering detailed imagery through clouds and at night. Nicknamed
  WADATSUMI-I, it provides monitoring services globally and is part of a broader
  commercial Earth observation campaign by iQPS. The SAR payload will bolster
  iQPS’s constellation capability for cloud-penetrating, night-time Earth
  observation.

Rocket Lab's Electron is scheduled to launch the 'The Sea God Sees' mission on May 17, 2025, at 08:15 UTC from Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand. The payload is iQPS's QPS-SAR-10 (WADATSUMI-I) synthetic aperture radar satellite, which can observe the Earth's surface through clouds and at night. This marks the third Electron launch for iQPS in a multi-launch campaign and is part of Rocket Lab’s continued efforts to deploy Japanese commercial Earth observation satellites as part of an expanding constellation. This mission will further strengthen iQPS's constellation capabilities and is Rocket Lab's sixth mission of the year.
