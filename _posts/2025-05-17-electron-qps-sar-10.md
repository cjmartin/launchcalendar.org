Rocket Lab has announced its next launch, 'The Sea God Sees', for long-term customer iQPS. The mission is scheduled to launch from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand during a window opening on May 17, 2025. It will carry the QPS-SAR-10 satellite, also known as WADATSUMI-I, a SAR imaging satellite designed to deliver high-resolution Earth observation imagery as part of the expanding iQPS constellation. This is the third overall Electron launch for iQPS and marks Rocket Lab's sixth mission of 2025, bringing their total satellite deployments to 225.
