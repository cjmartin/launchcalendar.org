  Rocket Lab Electron launched the 'The Sea God Sees' mission, carrying iQPS's
  QPS-SAR-10 (WADATSUMI-I/Wadatsumi-I) SAR satellite from New Zealand. The
  QPS-SAR-10 satellite, nicknamed 'WADATSUMI-I', is Japan's 10th addition to the
  iQPS commercial radar constellation, supporting high-resolution, all-weather,
  day-night Earth observation. The deployment furthers iQPS's goal of a
  36-satellite global SAR network and is part of their multi-mission contract
  with Rocket Lab.

payload-description: >-
  QPS-SAR-10 (WADATSUMI-I), also known as Wadatsumi-I, is a Japanese commercial
  synthetic aperture radar (SAR) Earth imaging satellite for iQPS. As the 10th
  in the QPS constellation, it is designed to capture high-resolution imagery of
  Earth day and night, through clouds and in all weather, joining iQPS'
  expanding SAR constellation. The satellite will be placed into a 575 km
  Sun-synchronous orbit, providing near real-time monitoring as part of the
  planned 36-satellite constellation to deliver global, all-weather, day-night
  Earth observation, and further expands iQPS's imagery constellation under an
  eight-launch contract with Rocket Lab.

Rocket Lab successfully launched the 'The Sea God Sees' mission, deploying iQPS's QPS-SAR-10 (WADATSUMI-I/Wadatsumi-I) synthetic aperture radar satellite into a 575-kilometer Sun-synchronous orbit on May 17, 2025, at 08:17 UTC. This was the 10th satellite for the Japanese iQPS SAR constellation, supporting high-resolution, day-or-night, all-weather global Earth monitoring. The launch is part of at least eight contracted Electron launches for iQPS through 2025 and 2026, bringing the company closer to a 36-satellite constellation for near real-time Earth observation. The mission marked Rocket Lab's sixth mission of 2025, its 64th Electron flight, and the third Electron mission for iQPS. The event was webcast live and widely covered in space media.
