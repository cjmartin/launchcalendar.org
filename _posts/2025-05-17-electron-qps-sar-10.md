Rocket Lab has scheduled its next Electron mission, 'The Sea God Sees', for May 17, 2025, from Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand. This launch will carry QPS-SAR-10 ('WADATSUMI-I'), a synthetic aperture radar imaging satellite—the 10th in the iQPS constellation—to a 575 km circular Sun-synchronous Earth orbit. The mission is the third overall Electron launch for iQPS as part of a multi-launch contract, and marks Rocket Lab’s sixth mission of 2025 and its 64th Electron launch, bringing their total satellite deployments to 225.
