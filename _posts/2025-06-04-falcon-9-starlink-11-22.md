SpaceX is targeting Wednesday, June 4, 2025, for the launch of its 50th Starlink mission of the year, deploying 27 Starlink v2 Mini satellites (Group 11-22) to a 53-degree-inclined low Earth orbit. Liftoff is scheduled for 4:28 p.m. PDT (2338 UTC) from Space Launch Complex 4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base, California. Falcon 9 booster B1063 will make its 26th flight and attempt landing on the droneship 'Of Course I Still Love You.' Local residents may hear sonic booms. A live webcast will be available on SpaceX's X account and X TV app. Backup windows are available until 7:18 p.m. PT. This mission continues the deployment of SpaceX's satellite internet constellation.
