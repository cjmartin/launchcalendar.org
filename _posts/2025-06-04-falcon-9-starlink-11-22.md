On June 4, 2025, SpaceX launched its 500th orbital Falcon rocket, marking the 15th anniversary of the Falcon 9’s debut. Liftoff occurred at 23:40 UTC (4:40 p.m. PDT) from Space Launch Complex 4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base, carrying 27 Starlink v2 Mini satellites as the Group 11-22 mission—SpaceX’s 68th Falcon 9 launch and 50th Starlink mission of 2025. Veteran booster B1063, the oldest Falcon 9 in active service, completed its record-setting 26th flight and landed successfully on the droneship 'Of Course I Still Love You.' The upper stage continued on to deploy the satellites, which joined the Starlink megaconstellation to provide global internet connectivity. Local residents reported sonic booms in nearby counties; backup windows were available, and a live webcast was available via SpaceX’s X account. This milestone demonstrates SpaceX’s rapid rocket reuse capability and the steady expansion of the Starlink broadband constellation.
