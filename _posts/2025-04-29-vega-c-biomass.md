description: >-
  On 29 April 2025, a Vega C rocket launched ESA's Biomass forest-monitoring
  satellite from the ELV launch pad at the Guiana Space Centre, Kourou, French
  Guiana, to a sun-synchronous orbit. Biomass is part of ESA's Earth Explorer
  program and features the first P-band synthetic aperture radar in space,
  designed to map and monitor global forests and measure carbon stocks.
  Manufactured by Airbus Defence and Space, Biomass supports climate science and
  will remain in orbit for at least five years. This marked the fourth flight of
  Vega C and the second since its post-2022 anomaly return to service,
  confirming a 100% post-return success rate. Following successful separation
  and contact, multi-day deployment of the large mesh radar antenna was
  initiated, enabling the satellite to advance global environmental and forest
  monitoring. Arianespace operated the launch, adding to a record-setting day in
  commercial spaceflight.

On 29 April 2025, Arianespace launched a Vega-C rocket carrying ESA's Biomass forest-monitoring satellite from the ELV launch pad at the Guiana Space Centre, Kourou, French Guiana, at 09:15 UTC. Biomass was deployed into a 666 km sun-synchronous orbit 57 minutes after liftoff. As ESA's seventh Earth Explorer Mission, the satellite features the first P-band synthetic aperture radar in space to precisely track global forest structure and carbon stocks, advancing climate and environmental research. Biomass, weighing about 1,130 kilograms and manufactured by Airbus Defence and Space, is intended to stay in orbit for at least five years. The flight was Vega C's fourth and its second after a 2022 anomaly, maintaining a 100% post-return success rate. Following separation, ESA confirmed contact and began a multi-day deployment of Biomass’s large mesh radar antenna. This launch was one of a record six launches that occurred globally within a 24-hour span. Coverage was provided across multiple sources and webcasts.
