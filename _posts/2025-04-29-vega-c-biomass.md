  On 29 April 2025, Arianespace launched ESA's Biomass Earth observation
  satellite on a Vega-C rocket from Ensemble de Lancement Vega (ELV) at the
  Guiana Space Centre, Kourou, French Guiana, to a sun-synchronous orbit.
  Biomass, developed and manufactured by Airbus Defence and Space for ESA's
  Earth Explorer program, features the first spaceborne P-band synthetic
  aperture radar—enabling high-resolution mapping and monitoring of global
  forests, carbon stocks, subsurface geology, and ice fields. The nearly 1,200
  kg satellite began deployment of its large unfurling mesh radar antenna after
  separation and contact, supporting advanced climate science and environmental
  monitoring. The mission was Vega-C's fourth overall flight and its second
  since a 2022 anomaly, maintaining a 100% post-return success rate. This launch
  was one of a record six rocket launches to occur globally within a 24-hour
  period. Biomass aims for at least five years of operations. The satellite's
  unique P-band SAR provides new capability to monitor the Earth's forests and
  their role in the carbon cycle.

  Biomass is ESA's seventh Earth Explorer mission, developed and manufactured by
  Airbus Defence and Space. It features the first spaceborne P-band synthetic
  aperture radar for global mapping of forest structure, carbon stocks,
  subsurface desert geology, and ice fields. The satellite weighs approximately
  1,170 kg and is launched into a sun-synchronous orbit, designed for a minimum
  operational life of five years. Biomass will deploy a large unfurling mesh
  antenna to enable its unique radar measurements, advancing global climate and
  environmental research. The mission's radar will provide unprecedented
  insights into the world's forests and their role in the carbon cycle.

The European Space Agency's Biomass satellite was launched on April 29, 2025, aboard a Vega-C rocket from French Guiana. Following launch, its large umbrella-like antenna was successfully deployed, marking the completion of its early operations phase. Biomass, weighing about 1,170 kg and built by Airbus Defence and Space as part of the ESA Earth Explorer program, carries the first-ever spaceborne P-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR), allowing it to penetrate forest canopies and measure carbon stocks and fluxes—crucial for understanding Earth's carbon cycle. After successful launch and deployment, the mission entered its commissioning phase with a planned five-year lifespan. This historic mission, Vega-C’s fourth and second since the 2022 anomaly, was also one of a record six global launches within a 24-hour period. The satellite is now commencing science operations, advancing forest and carbon cycle research.
