  On 29 April 2025, a Vega C rocket launched ESA's Biomass forest-monitoring
  satellite from the ELV launch pad at the Guiana Space Centre, Kourou, French
  Guiana, to a sun-synchronous orbit. Biomass is part of ESA's Earth Explorer
  program and features the first P-band synthetic aperture radar in space,
  designed to map and monitor global forests and measure carbon stocks. The
  mission aims to advance climate science, monitor global forest carbon storage
  and structure, and support environmental monitoring. Biomass, manufactured by
  Airbus Defence and Space, is the seventh Earth Explorer mission and will
  remain in orbit for at least five years. This launch marked the fourth flight
  for Vega C and the second since its return to service after a 2022 anomaly,
  maintaining its 100% post-return success rate. Following separation, ESA
  confirmed successful contact with Biomass, initiating the deployment process
  for its large mesh radar antenna.

On 29 April 2025, a Vega C rocket successfully launched the ESA Biomass forest-monitoring satellite from the ELV launch pad at the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana, at 09:15 UTC. Biomass was deployed into a 666 km sun-synchronous orbit 57 minutes after liftoff. It is ESA's seventh Earth Explorer Mission, equipped with the first P-band synthetic aperture radar in space to measure global forest structure and carbon stocks, supporting climate research and environmental monitoring. The satellite weighs approximately 1,130 kilograms and was manufactured by Airbus Defence and Space. This launch was the fourth Vega C flight and the second since its return to service after a 2022 anomaly, maintaining a 100% post-return success rate. Following separation, successful contact was established and ESA began the multi-day deployment of Biomass’s large mesh radar antenna. Multiple sources and live webcasts covered the event.
