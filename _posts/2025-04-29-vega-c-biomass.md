description: >-
  On 29 April 2025, Arianespace launched ESA's Biomass forest-monitoring
  satellite on a Vega C rocket from Ensemble de Lancement Vega (ELV) at the
  Guiana Space Centre, Kourou, French Guiana, to a sun-synchronous orbit.
  Biomass, developed and manufactured by Airbus Defence and Space for ESA's
  Earth Explorer program, features the first P-band synthetic aperture radar in
  space—enabling precise mapping and monitoring of global forests, carbon
  stocks, and geology. The nearly 1,200 kg satellite began multi-day deployment
  of its large unfurling mesh radar antenna after successful separation and
  contact, supporting climate science and advancing global environmental
  monitoring. The mission was Vega C's fourth overall flight and its second
  since a 2022 anomaly, maintaining a 100% post-return success rate. This launch
  was one of a record six rocket launches to occur globally within a 24-hour
  period. The minimum planned operational life for Biomass is five years.

Arianespace successfully launched the ESA Biomass satellite aboard Vega C from Kourou on 29 April 2025 at 09:15 UTC. Biomass, weighing approximately 1,170 kg and built by Airbus Defence and Space, deployed into a 660–666 km sun-synchronous orbit 57 minutes after liftoff. As ESA's seventh Earth Explorer mission, Biomass features the first spaceborne P-band synthetic aperture radar and a large mesh antenna, advancing climate and environmental research by measuring global forest structure and carbon stocks. The mission is planned for at least five years. This was Vega C’s fourth flight and second since its 2022 anomaly, maintaining a 100% post-return success rate. The launch was one of a record-setting six space launches globally in less than 24 hours. Coverage and mission updates were available from multiple sources.
