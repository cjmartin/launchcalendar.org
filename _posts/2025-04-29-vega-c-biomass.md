The European Space Agency's Biomass mission, part of its Earth Explorer program, is set to launch on April 29, 2025, at 09:15 UTC aboard an Arianespace Vega-C rocket (flight VV26) from the ZLV pad at Centre Spatial Guyanais, Kourou, French Guiana. Biomass is an Earth observation satellite designed to use P-band synthetic aperture radar for measuring the biomass of forests, with particular focus on tropical regions. The mission will enable accurate assessment of global carbon stocks and forest structure, aiding climate science and environmental monitoring. Manufactured by Airbus Defence and Space, Biomass is the first satellite to carry a P-band radar into space. The article provides background on the launch campaign, launch vehicle, payload, and mission objectives. A webcast of the launch is available, and additional links provide further information and live coverage.
