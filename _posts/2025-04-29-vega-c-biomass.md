  On 29 April 2025, Arianespace launched ESA's Biomass Earth observation
  satellite on a Vega-C rocket from Ensemble de Lancement Vega (ELV) at the
  Guiana Space Centre, Kourou, French Guiana, to a sun-synchronous orbit.
  Biomass, developed and manufactured by Airbus Defence and Space for ESA's
  Earth Explorer program, features the first spaceborne P-band synthetic
  aperture radar—enabling global mapping of forest height, biomass, carbon
  stocks, subsurface geology, and ice fields. The nearly 1,200 kg satellite
  began deployment of its large unfurling mesh radar antenna after separation
  and contact, supporting advanced climate science. This was Vega-C's fourth
  flight and its first of the year, part of a record six rocket launches
  globally within a 24-hour period. Biomass aims for at least five years of
  operations providing unprecedented data for forest and carbon studies.

  Biomass is ESA's seventh Earth Explorer mission, developed and manufactured by
  Airbus Defence and Space. It features the first spaceborne P-band synthetic
  aperture radar for global mapping of forest structure, carbon stocks,
  subsurface desert geology, and ice fields. The satellite weighs approximately
  1,170 kg and is launched into a sun-synchronous orbit, designed for a minimum
  operational life of five years. Biomass will deploy a large unfurling mesh
  antenna to enable its unique radar measurements, advancing global climate and
  environmental research.

On April 29, 2025 at 09:15 UTC, Arianespace's Vega-C rocket successfully launched the ESA Biomass satellite from Kourou, French Guiana, on its first flight of the year. This fourth Vega-C mission, and its second since returning after a 2022 anomaly, maintained its post-return success record. Biomass, weighing about 1,170 kg and developed by Airbus Defence and Space as part of ESA’s Earth Explorer program, carries the first spaceborne P-band synthetic aperture radar, a large unfurling mesh reflector, and aims to provide a global survey of forest height, biomass, subsurface geology, and ice sheets. The mission, one of a record six rocket launches within a 24-hour window, is planned for at least five years of operations advancing climate and environmental research.
