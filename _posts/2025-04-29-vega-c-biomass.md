  Vega-C will launch the European Space Agency's Biomass forest-monitoring
  satellite to sun-synchronous orbit from Kourou, French Guiana. Biomass is part
  of ESA's Earth Explorer program and aims to use P-band synthetic aperture
  radar to map and monitor global forests, especially tropical regions. The
  mission will support assessment of carbon storage and forest structure to
  advance climate science and environmental monitoring. This marks the fourth
  flight for Vega-C and the second since its return to flight.

The European Space Agency (ESA) is set to launch its Biomass forest-monitoring satellite aboard a Vega-C rocket from Europe's Spaceport (ZLV pad) in Kourou, French Guiana, on April 29, 2025, at 09:15 UTC. The Biomass spacecraft, weighing 1,130 kilograms, will be deployed to a sun-synchronous orbit at 666 kilometers altitude. The mission employs the first P-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) in space to map forest structure and monitor global carbon stocks over a five-year mission, with a special focus on tropical forests. Operated by Arianespace, this is the fourth Vega-C flight and the second since its return to service after a 2022 anomaly. Biomass was manufactured by Airbus Defence and Space, and the mission supports climate science and environmental monitoring. Multiple webcast and information sources provide launch and mission details.
