description: >-
  On 29 April 2025, Arianespace launched ESA's Biomass Earth observation
  satellite on a Vega-C rocket from Ensemble de Lancement Vega (ELV) at the
  Guiana Space Centre, Kourou, French Guiana, to a sun-synchronous orbit.
  Biomass, developed and manufactured by Airbus Defence and Space for ESA's
  Earth Explorer program, features the first spaceborne P-band synthetic
  aperture radar—enabling high-resolution mapping and monitoring of global
  forests, carbon stocks, subsurface geology, and ice fields. The nearly 1,200
  kg satellite began deployment of its large unfurling mesh radar antenna after
  separation and contact, supporting advanced climate science and environmental
  monitoring. The mission was Vega-C's fourth overall flight and its second
  since a 2022 anomaly, maintaining a 100% post-return success rate. This launch
  was one of a record six rocket launches to occur globally within a 24-hour
  period. Biomass aims for at least five years of operations.

  Biomass is ESA's seventh Earth Explorer mission, developed and manufactured by
  Airbus Defence and Space. It features the first spaceborne P-band synthetic
  aperture radar for global mapping of forest structure, carbon stocks,
  subsurface desert geology, and ice fields. The satellite weighs approximately
  1,170 kg and is launched into a sun-synchronous orbit, designed for a minimum
  operational life of five years. Biomass will deploy a large unfurling mesh
  antenna to enable its unique radar measurements, advancing global climate and
  environmental research.

Arianespace successfully conducted the first Vega-C rocket launch of 2025 on April 29, deploying ESA's Biomass satellite into a sun-synchronous orbit from Kourou, French Guiana. Biomass, weighing about 1,170 kg and built by Airbus Defence and Space, is part of the ESA Earth Explorer program and features the first spaceborne P-band synthetic aperture radar for high-resolution forest and terrain mapping, as well as a large mesh antenna. The launch successfully delivered the satellite, with the mission planned for at least five years of operations. This was Vega-C’s fourth flight, its second since a 2022 anomaly, maintaining post-return success. The mission was one of a record-setting six launches globally within a 24-hour period.
