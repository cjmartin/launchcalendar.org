Axiom Mission 4 (Ax-4), the fourth private astronaut mission managed by Axiom Space, will launch on a Falcon 9 rocket from LC-39A at Kennedy Space Center, Florida. The launch is now targeted for no earlier than June 8, 2025, after a delay due to ongoing preparations with Crew Dragon C213, including issues with propulsion and environmental control systems, and a battery replacement. The mission will carry Commander Peggy Whitson, Pilot Shubhanshu Shukla, and Mission Specialists Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski and Tibor Kapu for a roughly two-week stay aboard the International Space Station. Axiom and NASA plan a mission overview news conference on May 20 to discuss additional details.
