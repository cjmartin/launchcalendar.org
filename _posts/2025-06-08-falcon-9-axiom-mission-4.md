Axiom Mission 4 (Ax-4), the fourth private astronaut mission managed by Axiom Space, will launch on a Falcon 9 rocket from LC-39A at Kennedy Space Center, Florida. The mission will carry Commander Peggy Whitson, Pilot Shubhanshu Shukla, and Mission Specialists Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski and Tibor Kapu for a roughly two-week stay aboard the International Space Station. The mission was delayed to no earlier than June 8, 2025, due to ongoing preparations with Crew Dragon C213 and alignment with ISS scheduling.
