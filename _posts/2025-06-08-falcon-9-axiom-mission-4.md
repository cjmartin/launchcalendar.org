Axiom Mission 4 (Ax-4), the fourth private astronaut mission managed by Axiom Space, will launch on a Falcon 9 rocket from LC-39A at Kennedy Space Center, Florida. The four-person crew—Commander Peggy Whitson, Pilot Shubhanshu Shukla, and Mission Specialists Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski and Tibor Kapu—will spend about two weeks aboard the International Space Station. The mission was delayed to no earlier than June 8, 2025, due to the delayed readiness of the new Crew Dragon spacecraft (C213), which experienced technical issues. Axiom and NASA plan a mission overview news conference on May 20 to discuss details.
