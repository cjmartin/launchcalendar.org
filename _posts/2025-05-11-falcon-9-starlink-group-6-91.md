SpaceX will conduct the Starlink Group 6-91 mission from SLC-40, Cape Canaveral, now scheduled for May 11, 2025. This launch marks the 250th Falcon 9 mission from the pad and will deploy another batch of smallsats to the Starlink broadband constellation. Weather concerns including thunderstorms and cloudy conditions could affect the date. The Falcon 9 booster is expected to attempt an East Coast ASDS landing. As always, scheduling changes are possible for this 78th Starlink launch to the Group 6 shell.
