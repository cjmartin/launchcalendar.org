On April 27, 2025, SpaceX launched its 250th Starlink mission, sending 23 Starlink broadband satellites—including 13 with direct-to-cell capability—into low Earth orbit using a Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The booster completed its 20th flight with a successful landing on the drone ship "Just Read the Instructions." This was SpaceX's 48th Falcon 9 launch of the year and the 31st dedicated to the Starlink constellation, further expanding the Starlink v2-Mini broadband network.
