On April 28, 2025, SpaceX successfully launched the Starlink 11-9 mission atop a Falcon 9 rocket from SLC-4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base, California. This mission deployed 27 Starlink V2 Mini satellites into low Earth orbit, further expanding the SpaceX internet megaconstellation. The Falcon 9 first stage booster, B1063, completed its 25th flight and landed on the droneship 'Of Course I Still Love You' in the Pacific Ocean. The satellites will now maneuver into their operational orbits. This mission marks the 18th orbital launch of the year from Vandenberg, continuing the Starlink constellationâ€™s global expansion. Live coverage began 30 minutes prior to launch.
