Varda Space Industries successfully completed its third space capsule return mission as the W-3 capsule landed in South Australia on May 13, 2025, after launching aboard a Falcon 9 rocket on March 15 at 06:43 UTC. The mission was part of SpaceX's Transporter 13 rideshare and lifted off from Space Launch Complex 4 East (SLC-4E) at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. The Falcon 9 first stage booster (B1081) landed back at nearby Landing Zone 4 (LZ-4), marking another successful recovery.

W-3 spent 8.5 weeks in orbit, supporting a hypersonic navigation systems test for the U.S. Air Force in partnership with Innovative Scientific Solutions Incorporated (ISSI). The landing at Australia's Koonibba Test Range marked Varda's second mission to that site and demonstrated the company's high-cadence return capability. Varda's capsules rely on Rocket Labâ€™s Pioneer satellite bus for power, communications, and reentry support. W-4 is currently in preparation for a future mission.
