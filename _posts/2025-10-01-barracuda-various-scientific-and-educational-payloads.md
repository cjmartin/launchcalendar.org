Dutch rocket developer T-Minus Engineering will launch two Barracuda suborbital rockets from Spaceport Nova Scotia in October 2025. The launches are part of a partnership with Maritime Launch Services and will carry various scientific and educational payloads for multiple customers. The Barracuda can carry up to 40 kg to an altitude of about 120 km. The payloads' details have not been fully disclosed, and this marks the Barracuda's first civil launch in Canada amid some ambiguity about its prior launch history. The missions are intended to demonstrate integrated flight operations and support future hypersonic testing programs in Canada.
