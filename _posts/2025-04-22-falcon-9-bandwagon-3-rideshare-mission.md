  SpaceX Falcon 9 launched the Bandwagon-3 rideshare mission from Cape Canaveral
  Space Force Station, carrying South Korea's Korea 425 Project SAR satellite,
  Tomorrow-S7 weather monitoring satellite, and Atmos Space Cargo's Phoenix 1
  re-entry capsule to a mid-inclination orbit. The Bandwagon-3 flight
  demonstrated new satellite and re-entry capabilities: Phoenix 1, Europe's
  first private reentry capsule, tested an inflatable heat shield and conducted
  scientific experiments before reentering and splashing down in the Atlantic
  Ocean, though not recovered. The Falcon 9 booster B1090 landed back at LZ-2.

  The Bandwagon-3 mission is a Falcon 9 rideshare flight delivering a diverse
  range of payloads, including South Korea's 425 Project SAR satellite (the
  fourth in its military constellation), Tomorrow.io's Tomorrow-S7 weather
  monitoring satellite, and Europe’s Phoenix 1 re-entry capsule developed by
  Atmos Space Cargo to test inflatable heat shield technology. Phoenix 1, a
  prototype European reentry capsule, splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean after
  reentering Earth's atmosphere, though it was not recovered; the company plans
  a more advanced Phoenix 2 for 2026. The mission highlights advancements in
  remote sensing, weather prediction, and reentry technology, supporting
  experiments and industry technology demonstration.

On April 21, 2025 at 8:48 p.m. EDT (April 22, 0048 UTC), SpaceX launched the Bandwagon-3 rideshare mission from SLC-40, Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, marking the 300th orbital flight from the pad. The Falcon 9 carried a diverse set of payloads, including South Korea's fourth synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite for the Korea 425 Project constellation, Tomorrow.io's Tomorrow-S7 weather monitoring satellite, and Atmos Space Cargo’s Phoenix 1 capsule—the first private European reentry capsule. Phoenix 1 demonstrated reentry technology, including an inflatable heat shield, and supported scientific experiments before reentering Earth's atmosphere and splashing down in the Atlantic Ocean, though it was not recovered. Atmos plans a follow-on Phoenix 2 for 2026. The booster B1090 successfully landed at Landing Zone 2. The flight expands SpaceX's rideshare program and advances satellite and reentry technologies for a range of government and commercial customers.
