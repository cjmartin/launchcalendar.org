Vanguard 1, launched on March 17, 1958 from Cape Canaveral by a Vanguard rocket, remains the oldest artificial satellite still orbiting Earth. Developed by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, it was the first satellite to use solar cells for power. Despite the failure of the initial Vanguard launch attempt, Vanguard 1 succeeded in becoming the second U.S. satellite in space. The article details the satellite's historical significance, current orbit, scientific legacy, and recent proposals for its retrieval and study as a space-age artifact.
