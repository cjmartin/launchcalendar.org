The third Chang Zheng 6A rocket launch of 2025 took place from LC-9A, Taiyuan, on May 11 at 13:27 UTC. The payload consisted of three CAST-developed Yaogan satellites designed for electromagnetic environment probing. This mission continues China's use of the CZ-6A for a variety of Earth observation and communication satellite launches, with earlier launches lofting batches of Qianfan internet satellites. This marks the 99th orbital launch in 2025 and highlights China's expanding presence in low-Earth orbit.
