China successfully launched the Yaogan 40 Group 02, a trio of CAST-developed and classified Earth observation satellites, aboard a Chang Zheng 6A (Long March 6A) rocket from LC-9A at Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center on May 11, 2025. The satellites are designed for electromagnetic environment detection, technical tests, and probing in polar orbit, with few public details released due to their military nature. The mission featured an extended fairing and upgraded second stage, marking the 574th mission of the Long March rocket series and the 99th orbital launch of 2025, further demonstrating China's growing presence in low-Earth orbit.
