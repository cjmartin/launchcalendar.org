On May 11, 2025, the third Chang Zheng 6A rocket launch of the year took place from LC-9A at Taiyuan, sending three CAST-developed Yaogan 40 Group 02 satellites into polar orbit for electromagnetic environment probing. The launch reportedly used a fairing extension and upgraded second stage. This mission continues China's use of the CZ-6A for Earth observation and communication satellite launches, with earlier flights lofting batches of Qianfan internet satellites. It marks the 99th orbital launch in 2025 and underscores China's growing presence in low-Earth orbit.
