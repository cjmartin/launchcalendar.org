On May 11, 2025, at around 13:20 UTC, China will launch the third CZ-6A rocket of the year from LC-9A at Taiyuan. The payload is anticipated to be a batch of Qianfan internet communication satellites, continuing recent launches of this constellation. This will be the 99th orbital launch in 2025 and further expands China's presence in low-Earth orbit communications.
