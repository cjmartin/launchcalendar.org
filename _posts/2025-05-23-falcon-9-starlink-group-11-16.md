SpaceX is targeting Thursday, May 22 for the launch of Falcon 9 carrying the Starlink Group 11-16 small satellites to low-Earth orbit from SLC-4E, Vandenberg Space Force Base, California. The primary launch window is set for 11:19 p.m. ET (03:19 UTC on May 23), with backup options available shortly after. The mission will place 27 Starlink v2 Mini smallsats into a new polar low-Earth orbit shell as part of the expanding Starlink constellation, providing global internet coverage. The booster, B1075, will attempt a droneship landing on 'Of Course I Still Love You' after its 18th mission. Weather is expected to be favorable.
