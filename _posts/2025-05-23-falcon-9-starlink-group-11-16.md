On May 23, 2025, SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 rocket carrying 27 Starlink v2 Mini satellites for the Starlink Group 11-16 mission from SLC-4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base, California. Liftoff occurred at 22:32 UTC (4:32 p.m. local). Booster B1075 completed its 18th flight and landed on the droneship 'Of Course I Still Love You' in the Pacific Ocean, marking SpaceX's 450th overall Falcon booster landing. The Starlink satellites were successfully released into low Earth orbit about an hour after liftoff, further growing SpaceX's Starlink broadband constellation, which now numbers over 8,700 satellites in orbit. The launch was part of a busy weekend for SpaceX, with B1075 supporting its own record and live coverage available via SpaceX's X (formerly Twitter).
