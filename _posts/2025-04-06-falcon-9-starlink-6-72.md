On April 5, 2025 (April 6 UTC), SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 rocket carrying 28 Starlink internet satellites from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. The launch occurred at 11:07 p.m. EDT (0307 GMT on April 6). The rocket's first stage successfully landed on the drone ship 'Just Read the Instructions' in the Atlantic Ocean, marking its 19th flight and landing. The upper stage deployed the satellites into low Earth orbit about an hour after liftoff. This was SpaceX's 39th Falcon 9 mission of 2025, with most launches building out the Starlink constellation.
