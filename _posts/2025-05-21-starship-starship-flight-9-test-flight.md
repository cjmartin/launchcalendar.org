  SpaceX's Ship 35 and Booster 14 will conduct Starship's 9th uncrewed test
  flight, marking the first reflight of a Super Heavy booster. This flight will
  demonstrate vehicle reusability and gather data for further development toward
  Mars exploration. Ship 35 has completed static fire tests, though additional
  testing may be required after a non-nominal six-engine static fire delayed the
  targeted launch window.

SpaceX is preparing Starship's ninth test flight from Starbase, Texas, targeting May 21, 2025, pending FAA approval. Ship 35 and Booster 14 are set to fly, with Booster 14 becoming the first Super Heavy booster to fly a second time and 29 of its 33 engines being reused. Ship 35 has completed engine and static fire tests, but issues during a six-engine static fire have delayed the launch, which was previously targeted for early May. Additional testing may be required before a new launch date is confirmed. Several other Starship vehicles and boosters are also being readied for future flights at Starbase. Previous flights saw successful booster recovery but upper stage failures. Elon Musk is expected to give a Mars-focused talk at Starbase concurrent with the launch campaign.
