SpaceX is preparing to launch Starship's 9th test flight from Starbase, Texas, with a working target date of May 21, 2025, pending FAA approval. Elon Musk announced the planned launch and will also give a Mars-focused company talk at Starbase that will be live-streamed. This flight marks the first reuse of a Starship Super Heavy booster. Previous flights (Flight 7 and 8) faced upper stage failures, but boosters have been successfully recovered. The Flight 9 vehicle has completed static fire engine tests in preparation for launch.
