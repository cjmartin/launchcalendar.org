  The maiden test flight of Gilmour Space Technologies' Eris rocket, carrying a
  test payload for the company's micro-satellite bus to demonstrate orbital
  launch capability. This milestone mission marks Australia's first sovereign
  commercial orbital launch and the nation’s first attempt at an orbital
  hybrid-powered rocket flight. The flight aims to deliver the unnamed test
  payload to a sun-synchronous orbit, qualifying rocket systems and hybrid
  propulsion technology.

Gilmour Space Technologies is set for the historic maiden test flight of its Eris rocket—Australia's first sovereign orbital launch attempt in over 50 years—slated for May 14, 2025 from the Eris Pad at Bowen Orbital Spaceport in North Queensland. The Test Flight 1 mission will carry a test payload for Gilmour Space's micro-satellite bus, aiming to validate hybrid rocket orbital launch capabilities, rocket systems, and propulsion technology by reaching sun-synchronous orbit. This inaugural mission marks a significant milestone for Australia as its first domestically designed and manufactured commercial orbital rocket and the first orbital hybrid-powered rocket flight attempt from Australian soil.
