China is scheduled to launch a Long March 12 rocket (Chang Zheng 12) from LC-2 at Wenchang Space Launch Site on May 5, 2025, at 11:05 UTC. This mission will deploy a batch of SatNet LEO Group satellites for China's GuoWang (SatNet) broadband internet constellation, part of an ambitious plan to build a global network of nearly 13,000 satellites in competition with mega-constellations like SpaceX's Starlink and Amazon's Project Kuiper. The Long March 12, a medium-lift launch vehicle from CASC, began operations in late 2024. The Wenchang site offers strategic advantages due to its southern location and seaport delivery capabilities. This mission demonstrates the growing capacity of China Satellite Network Group's constellation to provide global broadband coverage.
