  China launched the Shenzhou 20 crewed spacecraft to the Tiangong space
  station, carrying three astronauts—commander Chen Dong (on his third
  spaceflight), Chen Zhongrui, and Wang Jie, both on their first missions. The
  mission will relieve the Shenzhou 19 crew and mark the ninth crewed trip to
  Tiangong and the sixth since the station's completion in 2022. The crew will
  embark on a six-month expedition, conducting EVAs and scientific experiments,
  with docking expected about six and a half hours after liftoff. The launch
  vehicle, Long March 2F (also known as Chang Zheng 2F/G), features recent
  upgrades including a redesigned capsule interior and increased payload
  capacity. The mission highlights China’s continued advancement and
  international collaborations in human space exploration.

China launched the Shenzhou 20 mission to the Tiangong space station on April 24, 2025, at 09:17 UTC from Site 901, Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre. The three-person crew—commander Chen Dong (on his third spaceflight), Chen Zhongrui, and Wang Jie (both on their first missions)—will relieve the Shenzhou 19 team and begin a six-month stay aboard Tiangong. After docking approximately 6.5 hours after launch, the astronauts are expected to perform EVAs and various science experiments. Shenzhou 20 is the ninth crewed trip to Tiangong, underscoring China's continuous human presence in orbit and expanding international outreach, including planned collaboration with Pakistan. Mission objectives, crew details, and the upcoming Tianzhou 9 cargo launch highlight China's growing ambitions in human spaceflight and station operations.
