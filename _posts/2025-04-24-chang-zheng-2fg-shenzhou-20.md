China’s 15th crewed spaceflight, Shenzhou 20, is scheduled to launch on April 24, 2025 at 09:17 UTC from Site 901 at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. The mission will send three taikonauts—commander Chen Dong, mission operator Chen Zhongrui, and science operator Wang Jie—to the Tiangong space station for a six-month expedition.

Led by veteran astronaut Chen Dong, the crew will relieve the Shenzhou 19 team and continue China’s streak of continuous human habitation aboard Tiangong. Docking is expected about six and a half hours after liftoff. During their stay, the crew will carry out EVAs and a range of science experiments.

The launch vehicle, a Chang Zheng 2F/G Y20, features recent upgrades including a redesigned capsule interior and a 20% increase in payload capacity. The mission coincides with the 55th anniversary of Dongfanghong-1 and China’s 10th annual Space Day, underscoring the country’s growing legacy in space exploration.
