  Kosmos 482, a Soviet Venus lander launched in 1972 as part of the Venera
  program, failed to escape Earth orbit due to a rocket anomaly. The spacecraft,
  built to survive a Venus landing, has remained in space for over 50 years and
  is anticipated to reenter Earth's atmosphere in May 2025. Risk to the public
  is considered extremely low, and the reentry is being closely tracked by
  international agencies.

  Kosmos 482 is a Soviet Venus lander, part of the Venera program, that was
  launched in 1972. Intended to reach and land on Venus, it became stranded in
  elliptical Earth orbit due to a premature cutoff of its Molniya-M upper stage.
  The nearly 500 kg, 1-meter-wide probe remains in orbit after more than 50
  years. Constructed with a titanium shell to withstand Venusian entry, it is
  expected to reenter Earth's atmosphere in May 2025. International space
  agencies are closely monitoring its trajectory, given its unique engineering
  and expected survivability during Earth's reentry.

Kosmos 482 (also known as Cosmos 482) is a failed Soviet Venus lander launched in March 1972 as part of the Venera program. The probe, with a titanium shell and weighing nearly 500 kg, became stranded in Earth orbit after a premature cutoff of its Molniya-M rocket's upper stage. Forecasts by ESA, Marco Langbroek, and The Aerospace Corporation estimate reentry around May 10, 2025, at 06:26–06:37 UTC (+/- 4.35 hours), with the location predicted anywhere between 52°N and 52°S latitude. Originally engineered to survive a descent through Venus' extreme environment, the spacecraft is expected to remain largely intact as it reenters Earth's atmosphere and poses a very low risk to the public. The event is being closely tracked by international agencies and astronomers, with ongoing live coverage and updates available through multiple articles and blogs providing technical analysis, safety commentary, and historical context.
