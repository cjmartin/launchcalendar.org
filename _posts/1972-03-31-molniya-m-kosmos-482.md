  Kosmos 482, a Soviet Venus lander launched in 1972 as part of the Venera
  program, became stranded in Earth orbit due to a premature cutoff of its
  Molniya-M rocket's upper stage. The spacecraft, weighing nearly 500 kg and
  built to survive a Venus landing, is now anticipated to reenter Earth's
  atmosphere after over 50 years in orbit, with risk to people on the ground
  considered extremely low.

payload-description: >-
  Kosmos 482 is a Soviet Venus lander, part of the Venera program, that was
  launched in 1972. Designed to withstand the harsh Venusian surface, the nearly
  500 kg, 1-meter-wide probe became stranded in Earth orbit due to a premature
  cutoff of its Molniya-M upper stage. Still in orbit after more than 50 years,
  Kosmos 482—a titanium-shelled descent craft intended for Venus—is closely
  monitored, as it is expected to reenter Earth's atmosphere in May 2025. While
  the probe was built for Venus' harsh conditions, its expected survivability
  through Earth's reentry is also closely watched by international
  organizations.

Kosmos 482 (also known as Cosmos 482) is a Soviet Venus lander that was launched in March 1972 as part of the Venera program, but failed to leave Earth orbit after a premature cutoff of its Molniya-M rocket's upper stage. The probe, weighing about 495 kg and protected by a titanium shell, has remained in Earth orbit for over 50 years. Predictions by ESA, Marco Langbroek, and The Aerospace Corporation estimate reentry around May 10, 2025, at 06:26 UTC (+/- 4.35 hours), with the exact location anywhere between 52°N and 52°S latitude. The reentry is being closely monitored by international agencies and astronomers, and risk to people on the ground is considered extremely low. Tracking efforts and updates continue to be provided in related articles.
