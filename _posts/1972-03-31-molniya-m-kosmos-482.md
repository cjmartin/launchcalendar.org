  Kosmos 482, a failed Soviet Venus lander launched in 1972 as part of the
  Venera program aboard a Molniya-M rocket, failed to escape Earth orbit due to
  a rocket anomaly and was stranded as space debris for over 50 years. The
  titanium-hulled probe reentered Earth's atmosphere over the Indian Ocean on
  May 10, 2025, after being tracked by international agencies and astronomers,
  with imagery captured during its final orbits. The event highlighted renewed
  discussion of legacy debris, reentry risks, and the historical context of the
  Venera program.

payload-description: >-
  Kosmos 482 is a Soviet Venus descent probe, part of the Venera program,
  launched in 1972. Intended to reach and land on Venus, it became stranded in
  Earth orbit as space debris for 53 years following a premature cutoff of its
  Molniya-M upper stage. Constructed with a titanium shell to withstand Venusian
  entry, the nearly 500 kg probe survived decades in orbit before reentering
  Earth's atmosphere over the Indian Ocean on May 10, 2025. The craft's robust,
  compact design originally engineered for Venusian survival contributed to the
  very low public risk upon its reentry. The spacecraft's reentry, monitored by
  international agencies and satellite watchers, renewed attention to the
  enduring challenges of legacy space debris and sparked context comparisons to
  similar events.

Kosmos 482, a Soviet Venus descent probe launched in 1972 as part of the Venera program aboard a Molniya-M rocket from Baikonur, failed to escape Earth orbit due to a rocket anomaly. Predicted and later confirmed to have reentered Earth's atmosphere over the Indian Ocean on May 10, 2025 after 53 years in orbit, the nearly 500 kg, titanium-shelled lander survived as legacy space debris. The reentry, widely tracked and analyzed by international agencies, ESA, and satellite watchers, presented extremely low public risk due to the probe's robust design. The event has prompted renewed discussion of legacy and future space junk, broader reentry environmental issues, and the historical role of the Venera missions, with extensive media coverage, risk assessments, and live tracking.
