A third Starlink launch, Group 6-83, is scheduled for May 11, 2025, from LC-39A at Kennedy Space Center. The Falcon 9 will deploy an unspecified number of v2 Mini satellites into low Earth orbit to support the global Starlink network. The first stage is planned to land on an East Coast droneship. Weather is a concern with possible showers and thunderstorms, and schedules may change accordingly.
