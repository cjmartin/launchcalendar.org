SpaceX is preparing to launch 28 Starlink v2 Mini satellites (Group 6-83) from LC-39A at Kennedy Space Center on May 12, 2025, with the launch window opening at 04:06 UTC. Using Falcon 9 booster B1067 on its record-breaking 28th flight, the mission aims to further expand SpaceX’s low Earth orbit internet constellation. This launch marks the 100th single-stick Falcon 9 flight from LC-39A. Weather forecasts indicate a 50% chance of favorable conditions, with some clouds and showers possible. Post-launch, SpaceX plans to recover B1067 on the drone ship 'Just Read the Instructions,' which would mark its 120th drone ship landing and SpaceX's 445th overall booster recovery.
