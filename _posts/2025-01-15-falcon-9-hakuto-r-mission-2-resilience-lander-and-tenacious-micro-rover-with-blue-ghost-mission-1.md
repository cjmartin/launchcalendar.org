Japanese company ispace launched the HAKUTO-R Mission 2 'Resilience' lunar lander with its Tenacious rover as a rideshare payload aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on January 15, 2025, along with Firefly's Blue Ghost Mission 1. The Resilience lander entered lunar orbit in May 2025 and is scheduled to attempt a landing in Mare Frigoris. The mission features a suite of payloads from international partners, including a miniature house art piece, a soil analysis rover task for NASA, a water electrolyzer, food production experiment, radiation probe, and a UN language memory disk. The article details the mission timeline from launch, trajectory, and lunar orbital insertion, to the upcoming landing attempt. Several links provide further community discussion, and a NASA Spaceflight video covers the launch event.
