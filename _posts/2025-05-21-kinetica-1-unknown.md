On May 21, 2025 at 04:05 UTC, China's Kinetica 1 solid-fueled rocket launched six satellites into orbit from Site 130 at Jiuquan, with two being Earth observation satellites (Taijing-3-04, Taijing-4-02A). This was the first Kinetica 1 flight of the year and the rocket's seventh mission overall. The specific identities of the other satellites remain undisclosed, and the mission trajectory is believed to be southwesterly.
