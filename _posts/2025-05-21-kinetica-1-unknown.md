  Chinese Kinetica 1 (Lijian-1) rocket launched six satellites, including
  Taijing-3-04 and Taijing-4-02A, to orbit from Jiuquan, returning to flight
  after a previous failure. The satellites support Earth observation and feature
  multispectral and sub-meter imaging capabilities.

On May 21, 2025 at 04:05 UTC, CAS Space returned its Kinetica 1 (Lijian-1) rocket to flight from Site 130 at Jiuquan after a previous failure in December. The mission launched six satellites, including two Earth observation satellites (Taijing-3-04 and Taijing-4-02A), featuring multispectral and sub-meter imaging capabilities. Other payload identities were not disclosed, and the mission trajectory is believed to be southwesterly. This marked the first Kinetica 1 flight of 2025 and the seventh mission of the rocket, as CAS Space continued its healthy launch cadence.
