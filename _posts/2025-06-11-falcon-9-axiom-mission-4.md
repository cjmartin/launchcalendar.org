SpaceX is targeting 8:00 a.m. ET (12:00 UTC) on Wednesday, June 11, 2025, for the launch of Axiom Mission 4 (Ax-4) aboard a Falcon 9 rocket from Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center. This highly anticipated mission will send four astronauts—Peggy Whitson, Shubhanshu Shukla, Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski, and Tibor Kapu—from the US, India, Poland, and Hungary to the International Space Station, marking the first government-sponsored human spaceflights in over 40 years for India, Poland, and Hungary. Crew Dragon C213 will make its first flight, while the Falcon 9’s first stage will be reused for its second flight and will attempt a landing at Landing Zone 1. Over 60 scientific and technological experiments are planned for the two-week stay, focusing on human health, biology, Earth observation, and technology demonstrations, highlighting international participation in commercial spaceflight. The mission was delayed for repairs following a liquid oxygen leak and thrust vector control issue found on booster B1094. A mission overview news conference was scheduled for May 20, with launch backup opportunities on June 12. Live coverage will be available via SpaceX’s social channels.
