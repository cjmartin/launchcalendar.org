The SpaceX Falcon 9 launch of Axiom Mission 4 (Ax-4), a commercial mission carrying four astronauts—Peggy Whitson (USA), Shubhanshu Shukla (India), Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski (Poland), and Tibor Kapu (Hungary)—to the International Space Station, has been indefinitely postponed following leak issues discovered on the launch vehicle and on the ISS's Zvezda module. The mission was scheduled for 8:00 a.m. ET (12:00 UTC) on June 11, 2025, from Launch Complex 39A, Kennedy Space Center, and would have marked the debut flight of Crew Dragon C213 and the second use of booster B1094, with a planned RTLS landing at LZ-1. This mission features the first government-sponsored human spaceflights to the ISS in more than 40 years for India, Poland, and Hungary, and included plans for over 60 research experiments spanning 31 countries. No new launch date has been set as investigations and repairs continue.
