SpaceX plans to launch the Starlink Group 6-67 mission from SLC-40 at Cape Canaveral on May 14, 2025, at 15:43 UTC, carrying Starlink v2 Mini satellites to low Earth orbit at a 43-degree inclination for the company's satellite internet constellation. The booster ID is not yet known, and the booster will be recovered on an east coast droneship. This will be the 58th Falcon 9 flight of 2025 and the eighth Falcon 9 launch in May.
