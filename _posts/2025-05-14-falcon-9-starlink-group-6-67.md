SpaceX is scheduled to launch the Starlink Group 6-67 mission from SLC-40 at Cape Canaveral on May 14, 2025, at 16:38 UTC (12:38 p.m. ET), carrying 28 Starlink v2 Mini satellites to low Earth orbit at a 43-degree inclination for the company's satellite internet constellation. The Falcon 9 first stage booster, flying for the fourth time, will attempt landing on the 'A Shortfall of Gravitas' droneship. Backup launch windows are available until 2:47 p.m. ET and on May 15 if needed. This is expected to be the 58th Falcon 9 flight of 2025 and the eighth Falcon 9 launch in May. Favorable launch weather is expected, and the webcast will be available via SpaceX’s X (Twitter) social media and X TV app.
