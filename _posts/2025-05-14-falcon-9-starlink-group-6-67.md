On May 14, 2025, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket (B1090-4) launched the Starlink Group 6-67 mission from SLC-40, Cape Canaveral at 16:38 UTC (12:38 p.m. ET), deploying 28 Starlink v2 Mini Optimized satellites to a 43-degree-inclined orbit. The booster, previously used on Crew-10, Bandwagon-3, and SES’s O3b mPOWER 7/8 missions, completed its fourth flight and landed on the droneship 'A Shortfall of Gravitas.' This marked the 58th Falcon 9 launch of 2025 and raised the total number of active Starlink satellites to over 7,400 as SpaceX continues expanding its global broadband constellation. The SpaceX webcast was available via X (Twitter) and X TV. Backup opportunities were available later the same day and the following day if needed.
