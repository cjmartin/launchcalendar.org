On May 14, 2025, SpaceX's Falcon 9 B1090-4 launched 28 Starlink v2 Mini Optimized satellites (Group 6-67) from SLC-40, Cape Canaveral at 16:38 UTC (12:38 p.m. ET), destined for a 43-degree inclined low Earth orbit. The launch increased the total number of operational Starlink satellites to over 7,000 as part of SpaceX’s global internet network expansion. The booster completed its fourth flight, landing successfully on the droneship 'A Shortfall of Gravitas.' Favorable launch weather was expected (95% chance), with backup opportunities later on May 14 and on May 15. The webcast was available via SpaceX’s X (Twitter) and X TV apps.
