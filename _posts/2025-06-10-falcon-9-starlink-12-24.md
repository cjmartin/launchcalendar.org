On June 10, 2025, SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 carrying 23 Starlink V2 Mini satellites—including 13 equipped with Direct to Cell capability—at 9:05 a.m. EDT from SLC-40, Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. Booster B1083, on its 12th flight (previously flying missions such as Crew-8, Polaris Dawn, CRS-31, and Starlink), successfully landed on the droneship 'Just Read the Instructions' in the Atlantic. The launch marked the 500th Falcon rocket flight and SpaceX's 71st mission of 2025, further expanding the Starlink constellation, which aims to provide global internet service. Weather conditions were highly favorable, and SpaceX confirmed successful satellite deployment as part of ongoing partnerships, such as with T-Mobile, to extend mobile connectivity worldwide.
