SpaceX scheduled the launch of Starlink Group 12-19, carrying 23 Starlink satellites (13 with direct-to-cell capabilities), from SLC-40 at Cape Canaveral. The mission was rescheduled from June 2 to June 3, 2025, now targeting 04:42 UTC. Falcon 9 booster B1077 will make its 21st flight, aiming for a droneship landing on 'Just Read the Instructions' after a southeasterly ascent to low Earth orbit. The launch has a 75% chance of favorable weather and will be webstreamed, including on SpaceX’s X account. This mission continues SpaceX's rapid expansion of the Starlink constellation, with 13 satellites equipped for Direct to Cell communications.
