SpaceX scrubbed its planned Monday morning launch of the Starlink Group 12-19 mission due to a severe geomagnetic storm caused by a coronal mass ejection, retargeting for Tuesday, June 3 at 12:43 a.m. EDT (0443 UTC) from SLC-40, Cape Canaveral. The 21st flight of Falcon 9 booster B1077 will deploy 23 Starlink satellites, including 13 with direct-to-cell capability, into low Earth orbit following a southeasterly ascent. The attempt will feature a droneship landing on 'Just Read the Instructions.' Weather was generally favorable, though solar activity was a concern. SpaceX will livestream the mission, including on X (formerly Twitter) and X TV. This mission continues to rapidly expand the Starlink network, specifically adding more direct-to-cell satellites.
