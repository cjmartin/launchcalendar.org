On June 3, 2025, SpaceX successfully launched 23 Starlink satellites (Group 12-19), including 13 with Direct to Cell capabilities, to low-Earth orbit from SLC-40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida. The Falcon 9 lifted off at 12:43 a.m. ET under cloudy weather, marking the booster’s 21st flight. The booster previously supported several key missions and landed on the Just Read the Instructions droneship in the Atlantic Ocean. The mission faced weather and space weather constraints, including a delay due to a coronal mass ejection, but proceeded after rescheduling. This launch expanded the Starlink constellation to over 7,600 satellites in orbit, further strengthening global connectivity. Live coverage was provided on SpaceX’s X account and the X TV app.
