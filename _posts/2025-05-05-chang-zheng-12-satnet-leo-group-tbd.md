On May 5, 2025, at 11:05 UTC, China's Chang Zheng 12 (Long March 12) is scheduled to launch a batch of LEO communications satellites for the SatNet (GuoWang) constellation from LC-2 at Wenchang. This mission is part of China's ambitious effort to build a global broadband internet constellation of nearly 13,000 satellites, supporting the China Satellite Network Group's (GuoWang) growing LEO constellation to compete with Starlink and Project Kuiper. The Wenchang launch site offers strategic advantages for such large missions, and this flight will further demonstrate the capabilities of the new Long March 12 rocket.
