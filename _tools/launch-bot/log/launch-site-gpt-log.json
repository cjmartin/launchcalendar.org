This marks the start of Amazon's plan to build a massive constellation of over 3,200 satellites to provide global internet coverage, in competition with SpaceX's Starlink network. The satellites will be raised to their operational orbits after initial deployment. The launch experienced previous weather-related delays but ultimately proceeded successfully. Most of the future Kuiper launches will also use ULA's Atlas V and Vulcan Centaur, with some contracts awarded to Blue Origin, SpaceX, and Arianespace.","links":[{"title":"Atlas V rocket","type":["reference"],"url":"https://www.space.com/40250-atlas-v-rocket.html"},{"title":"Cape Canaveral","type":["reference"],"url":"https://www.space.com/33926-cape-canaveral.html"},{"title":"Project Kuiper","type":["reference"],"url":"https://www.space.com/amazon-project-kuiper-megaconstellation-launch-deals"},{"title":"About Amazon: Project Kuiper satellite internet first launch","type":["reference"],"url":"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/project-kuiper-satellite-internet-first-launch"},{"title":"Atlas V rocket launches Amazon's 1st 2 internet satellites to orbit (video)","type":["related"],"url":"https://www.space.com/atlas-v-rocket-launches-first-two-project-kuiper-satellites-amazon"},{"title":"Amazon gets a green light to launch 3,000-satellite Kuiper constellation","type":["related"],"url":"https://www.space.com/fcc-approves-amazon-constellation-kuiper"},{"title":"Blinded by the light: How bad are satellite megaconstellations for astronomy?","type":["related"],"url":"https://www.space.com/satellite-megaconstellations-spacex-starlink-interference-astronomy"},{"title":"Vulcan Centaur rocket","type":["reference"],"url":"https://www.space.com/vulcan-centaur-rocket"},{"title":"SpaceX","type":["reference"],"url":"https://www.space.com/18853-spacex.html"},{"title":"US Space Force","type":["reference"],"url":"https://www.space.com/us-space-force-history-mission-capabilities"},{"title":" Amazon launches 27 satellites to begin building huge 'Project Kuiper' internet constellation (video) ","type":["article","source"],"url":"https://www.space.com/space-exploration/launches-spacecraft/amazon-launches-27-satellites-to-begin-building-huge-project-kuiper-internet-constellation"}],"videos":[]},"fuzzyMatch":{"id":"slc-40-cape-canaveral-space-force-station-florida-usa","score":0.6666666666666666,"verdict":"gpt_check"},"gptResponse":{"decision":"new_site","proposed":{"slug":"slc-41-cape-canaveral-space-force-station-florida-usa","site_name":"SLC-41","location":"Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, USA","geo":{"latitude":28.5832,"longitude":-80.5831},"operator":"United Launch Alliance","launch_vehicles":["atlas-v","vulcan-centaur"]},"reasoning":"While the launch location matches Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, the vehicle involved is an Atlas V, which is not launched from SLC-40 (a SpaceX Falcon 9 pad).
