Because of this delay, SpaceX agreed to adjust the launch profile for the mission to give the satellite an extra push and reduce the time it will take to reach the desired orbit.\n\nIn addition to the initial 6 month delay, the launch was scrubbed 4 times due to various complications around using super cooled liquid oxygen. SpaceX is cooling the liquid oxygen more than usual in order to carry more fuel for the launch and landing attempt. However, this seems to make fueling and maintaining fuel levels [substantially more difficult](http://www.wired.com/2016/03/spacex-keeps-aborting-liftoffs-rocket-fuel-tricky/).\n\nAfter separation, the first stage of the Falcon 9 will perform reentry and attempt to land on the SpaceX barge [“Of Course I Still Love You”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_spaceport_drone_ship#Of_Course_I_Still_Love_You_.28Marmac_304.29) in the Atlantic Ocean.
