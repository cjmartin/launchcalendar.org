The launch, delayed for over a month due to weather and range restrictions, is now scheduled for April 28, 2025, with a window opening at 13:37 UTC from Space Launch Complex 2 West at Vandenberg Space Force Base. The mission is a technology demonstration for Lockheed Martin’s LM 400 satellite bus, part of a larger Lockheed contract for up to 25 Alpha launches. The LM 400 was encapsulated in March and will demonstrate its capabilities on a roughly 30-day low Earth orbit mission, after which it will perform a controlled de-orbit. The partnership between Firefly and Lockheed marks an expansion in rapid launch services for government and commercial customers. The article provides insight into the mission’s background, development, and operational goals, as well as range and weather challenges encountered in scheduling the launch.","links":[{"title":"Nellis AFB: SMC stands up new Space Safari program office","type":["news","background"],"url":"https://www.nellis.af.mil/News/Article/2653453/smc-stands-up-new-space-safari-program-office/"},{"title":"Firefly Aerospace to launch Lockheed Martin LM400 tech demo satellite on Alpha rocket from Vandenberg","type":["article","source"],"url":"https://spaceflightnow.com/2025/04/26/firefly-aerospace-to-launch-lockheed-martin-lm400-tech-demo-satellite-on-alpha-rocket-from-vandenberg/"}],"videos":[{"title":"Firefly Alpha FLTA006 'Message in a Booster' Launch","type":["video","livestream"],"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/P4wYA10FzI8?si=q3c4iyiCJ9rFWOBG"}]},"fuzzyMatch":{"id":"slc-2-vandenberg-space-force-base-california-usa","score":0.7272727272727273,"verdict":"gpt_check"},"gptResponse":{"decision":"match","slug":"SLC-2","reasoning":"The launch location in the data is 'Space Launch Complex 2 West (SLC-2W), Vandenberg Space Force Base, California,' which directly references SLC-2 at Vandenberg.

The LM400 is designed as a multi-mission satellite platform for commercial, civil, and military uses, and this flight also marks the first of up to 25 missions in a multi-launch agreement between Firefly and Lockheed Martin. The LM400 on this mission is equipped with a communications payload and is intended to validate key capabilities of the bus. Firefly Alpha's four Reaver engines will power the rocket through ascent, and the LM400 will separate about 12 minutes after launch. This is the first Alpha flight of 2025, with more planned throughout the year.
