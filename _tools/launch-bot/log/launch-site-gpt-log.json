The rocket, repurposed from a former Peacekeeper ICBM, successfully launched the NROL-174 mission for the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). The payload is classified, with few details released about its nature, typical for NRO launches. The mission was conducted through the US Space Force's Rocket Systems Launch Program and is described as placing multiple national security payloads into orbit. The launch is notable as a return-to-flight for the Minotaur IV, which last flew in July 2020 from Virginia.","links":[{"title":"Vandenberg Space Force Base","type":["launch_site","information"],"url":"https://www.space.com/34147-vandenberg-air-force-base.html"},{"title":"NRO press release: NROL-174 Mission Success","type":["press_release"],"url":"https://www.nro.gov/Portals/135/Documents/news/press/2025/250416%20NROL-174%20Press%20Release%20FINAL.pdf?ver=Tn6TGqMsZR2Y9EZ5XzdBLw%3D%3D"},{"title":"NROL-174 Mission Press Kit","type":["press_kit"],"url":"https://www.nro.gov/Portals/135/Documents/news/Press%20Kits/10417_Press%20Kit%20book_Launch_NROL-174_4.9.25.pdf?ver=rVWcO_lQgII6AtBD-b5wAw%3d%3d"},{"title":" Minotaur 4 rocket, repurposed from intercontinental ballistic missile, launches secret US spy satellites to orbit from California (video) ","type":["article","source"],"url":"https://www.space.com/space-exploration/launches-spacecraft/rocket-repurposed-from-intercontinental-ballistic-missile-launches-secret-us-spy-satellites-to-orbit-from-california"}],"videos":[{"title":"Minotaur 4 rocket, repurposed from intercontinental ballistic missile, launches secret US spy satellites to orbit from California (video)","type":["launch","news","video"],"url":"https://www.space.com/minotaur-4-rocket-nrol-174-launch-video"}]},"fuzzyMatch":{"id":"slc-2-vandenberg-space-force-base-california-usa","score":0.625,"verdict":"gpt_check"},"gptResponse":{"decision":"match","slug":"SLC-2","reasoning":"The launch location is 'Vandenberg Space Force Base, California' and the vehicle is a Minotaur IV, which has historically launched from SLC-2 at Vandenberg.
