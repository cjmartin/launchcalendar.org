Boeing's Starliner CFT mission launched NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams in June 2024 for an originally planned eight-day stay aboard the International Space Station. Due to technical issues with the Starliner capsule, their return was delayed for over nine months, requiring integration with the ongoing Crew-9 mission. Butch and Suni finally returned to Earth on March 18, 2025, highlighting the contingency plans required for long-duration space missions and the resilience of ISS operations. The incident draws parallels with several other historical missions where astronauts had unexpected extended stays in orbit due to spacecraft or operational challenges. The article also discusses prior cases such as Mark Vande Hei, Frank Rubio, and missions during the Shuttle and Mir era.
