NASA's Lucy spacecraft, launched on October 16, 2021 aboard an Atlas V from Cape Canaveral, is on a groundbreaking 12-year journey to explore 11 asteroids, including main belt asteroid Donaldjohanson and several Jupiter Trojan asteroids. The article details Lucy's April 20, 2025 flyby of Donaldjohanson, which provided novel scientific insights into asteroid formation, collisions, and planetary history. The mission leverages extensive engineering, including large solar arrays, for deep space operation and is intended to foster a better understanding of the origins of our solar system. The Lucy spacecraft also carries a commemorative plaque with messages for future generations.
