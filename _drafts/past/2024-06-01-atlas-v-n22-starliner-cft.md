The article tells the stories of several astronauts whose missions were unexpectedly extended, focusing on Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams who launched on Boeing’s Starliner CFT in June 2024. Planned for only eight days, their ISS mission lasted more than nine months due to technical issues with Starliner, eventually returning via a SpaceX Crew Dragon on March 18, 2025. The piece puts their experience in context alongside others who spent extended periods on the ISS and other space stations.
