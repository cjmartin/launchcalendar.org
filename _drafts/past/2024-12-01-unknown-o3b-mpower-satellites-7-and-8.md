SES launched its seventh and eighth O3b mPOWER satellites in December 2024 to strengthen its Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) network. These satellites, featuring enhanced payload power modules, are now ready to deliver global connectivity services. SES’s O3b mPOWER system began global service in April 2024, operating eight of thirteen planned satellites with an extensive network of ground gateways worldwide, expanding network capacity and supporting high throughput and low latency for customers globally.
