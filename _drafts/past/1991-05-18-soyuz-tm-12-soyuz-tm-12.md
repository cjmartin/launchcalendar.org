On May 18, 1991, Sergei Krikalev launched aboard Soyuz TM-12 for a Mir expedition. The collapse of the Soviet Union and operational challenges led to Krikalev staying onboard through significant political change, returning after 311 days. His mission exemplified how international and financial issues can impact astronaut return plans.
