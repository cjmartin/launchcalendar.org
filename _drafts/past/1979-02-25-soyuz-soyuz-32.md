Vladimir Lyakhov and Valery Ryumin launched on Soyuz 32 in February 1979 to the Salyut 6 space station. After engine failure on their planned return vehicle Soyuz 33, the cosmonauts remained in orbit until Soyuz 34 brought them home after 175 days, underscoring early long-term spaceflight risks and contingencies.
