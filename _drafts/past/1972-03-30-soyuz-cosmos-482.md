  A Soviet Venus descent probe (sister to Venera 8) intended to land on Venus,
  but stranded in Earth orbit after a failed upper stage cutoff. The probe has a
  mass of 495 kg, carries significant thermal protection, and was designed to
  survive the intense heat of Venusian atmospheric entry.

The article discusses the upcoming uncontrolled reentry of Cosmos 482, a failed Soviet Venus lander that has orbited Earth since its launch in late March 1972. The probe, a twin of Venera 8, was stranded due to a premature rocket cutoff. Observers expect reentry around May 9-10, 2025, and highlight the probe's sturdy construction for Venus' harsh atmosphere, raising speculation about its potential survival through Earth's reentry. The article quotes satellite trackers' modeling, outlines technical details, and contextualizes Cosmos 482 among other Soviet Venus missions. Risks posed by the falling probe are described as comparable to a meteorite impact.
