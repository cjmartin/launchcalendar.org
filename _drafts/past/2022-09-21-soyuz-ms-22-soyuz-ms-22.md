Frank Rubio, along with Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitry Petelin, launched on Soyuz MS-22 on September 21, 2022, for a planned six-month ISS mission. A coolant leak in their return vehicle led to MS-23 being launched empty for crew rescue. The extended mission lasted 371 days—the longest single US spaceflight. The article details the incident, NASA and Roscosmos decisions, and the emergency seat liner transfer to Crew Dragon for evacuation contingency.
