On April 9, 2021, NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei launched aboard Soyuz MS-18 from Baikonur with two cosmonauts, initially for a six-month ISS stay. Reassignment for a Russian movie crew extended his stay to almost a year, setting a new American record for consecutive days in space. The article details Vande Hei's mission extension, the influence of the Russian film 'The Challenge', and contingency plans for return.
