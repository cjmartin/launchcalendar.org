Space Shuttle Endeavour's STS-113 mission launched on November 25, 2002, delivering Expedition 6 crew to the ISS. The loss of Shuttle Columbia delayed their return, necessitating a Soyuz return after over four months aboard the ISS. The crew originally intended to return on Shuttle, but were brought home in Soyuz TMA-1 after a dramatic ballistic reentry, highlighting challenges faced during the post-Columbia transition.
