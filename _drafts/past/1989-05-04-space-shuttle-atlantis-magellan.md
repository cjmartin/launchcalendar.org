This article discusses how data collected more than 30 years ago by NASAâ€™s Magellan spacecraft, which was launched by Space Shuttle Atlantis during the STS-30 mission in May 1989, is still providing new insight into tectonic processes and the structure of Venus. The Magellan mission mapped the surface and gravity of Venus and provided key topography and gravity datasets for the latest scientific studies on Venusian coronae. Magellan entered Venusian orbit in August 1990 and operated until its atmospheric entry in 1994, demonstrating the long-term value of planetary missions. The methods developed in this research will assist with analysis of data from upcoming Venus missions.
