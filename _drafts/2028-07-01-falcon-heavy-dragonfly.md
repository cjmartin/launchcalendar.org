NASA's Dragonfly mission is scheduled to launch atop a SpaceX Falcon Heavy in July 2028. This rotorcraft lander will fly across Saturn's moon Titan to investigate its chemistry, searching for prebiotic conditions that might have led to the genesis of life. Dragonfly will study areas such as the Selk Crater for evidence of chemical processes akin to those believed to have occurred on early Earth. Using its suite of scientific instruments, Dragonfly aims to provide insights into how life began and test theories about prebiotic chemistry on an uninhabitable world.
