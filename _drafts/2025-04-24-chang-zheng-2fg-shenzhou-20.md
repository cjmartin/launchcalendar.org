China's 15th crewed spaceflight, Shenzhou 20, is scheduled to launch from Jiuquan's Site 901 on April 24, 2025, carrying three taikonauts to the Tiangong space station for a six-month expedition. The crew, led by veteran Chen Dong, will relieve the Shenzhou 19 crew, with docking to occur about six and a half hours post-launch. The mission underscores continued human presence and operations aboard Tiangong.
