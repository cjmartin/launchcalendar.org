The Meteosat Third Generation Sounder 1 (MTG-S1), carrying the Sentinel-4 atmospheric monitoring instrument and the MTG-S Infrared Sounder, has arrived at Cape Canaveral for launch preparations. The satellite, built by OHB and transported by the MN Colibri cargo ship, will soon begin its launch campaign at Astrotech facilities. The launch is scheduled for July 2025, sending the satellite to geostationary orbit. This mission marks the first deployment of an infrared sounder in geostationary orbit for Europe, promising crucial advances in weather forecasting and air quality monitoring over Europe and North Africa.
