SpaceX continues preparations for its next Starship launch, with Ship 35 and Booster 14 set to fly on Flight 9. Ship 35 has completed engine and static fire tests at Masseys test site, but issues during testing (including a non-nominal six-engine static fire) have delayed the launch, originally targeted for around May 9/10, 2025. This mission is notable as Booster 14 will become the first Super Heavy booster to fly a second time, with 29 of its 33 engines being reused. While the next steps for Ship 35 are uncertain and additional testing may be required, several other Ships and Boosters are in various stages of preparation for subsequent flights. The article details recent progress across SpaceX's Starbase facilities but notes that no official confirmation for a new launch window has been given.
