SpaceX is preparing a fleet of Starship vehicles for upcoming flights, with Ship 35 recently completing static fire engine testing. Ship 35, paired with Booster 14, will fly on Starship Flight 9, which will be the first reflight of a Super Heavy booster. Static fire testing revealed some issues possibly related to Raptor Vacuum engine shutdown, leading to a slight schedule slipâ€”the tentative launch date of May 9-10 was ruled out. SpaceX is conducting post-test processing on Ship 35 while other ships (36, 37, 38, and 39) progress at various assembly and testing stages. Flight dates for subsequent launches remain highly dependent on results and post-flight analysis. The article provides in-depth updates on Starship program status and booster plans.
