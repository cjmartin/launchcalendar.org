On April 16, 2025 at 19:33 UTC (12:33 p.m. PDT), Northrop Grumman launched a Minotaur 4 rocket from Space Launch Complex 8 (SLC-8) at Vandenberg, California, marking the vehicle's first flight from the site in nearly 14 years. The mission, designated NROL-174 and operated by the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), carried multiple classified national security payloads. The four-stage Minotaur 4 is a repurposed Peacekeeper ICBM, with this flight executed under the Rocket Systems Launch Program managed by the U.S. Space Force's Space Systems Command. No livestream was provided, but the launch was recorded by the University of California San Diegoâ€™s ALERTCalifornia program. The rocket successfully placed its payload into orbit. This marks the third Minotaur launch for the NRO since July 2020. Additional Minotaur launches for NRO and the U.S. Space Force are scheduled in the coming years.
