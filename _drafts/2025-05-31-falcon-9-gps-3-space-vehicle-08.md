SpaceX is preparing to launch the GPS 3 SV-08 satellite, named "Katherine Johnson," for the U.S. Space Force from SLC-40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in late May 2025. This launch is part of an accelerated mission timeline, following a similar fast-tracked GPS 3 launch in December 2024. The GPS 3 SV-08 is an M-Code-capable satellite enhancing jam resistance for military navigation. The mission was originally assigned to a ULA Vulcan rocket but was swapped to the Falcon 9 to speed deployment, demonstrating flexibility in the U.S. launch manifest. Lockheed Martin, the satellite manufacturer, is also progressing with next-generation GPS 3F satellites for future launches.
