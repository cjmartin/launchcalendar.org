On March 6, 2025, SpaceX conducted a test launch of its Starship Flight 8 vehicle. The vehicle exploded during reentry, scattering debris over parts of the Bahamas. This event may have contributed to the Bahamian government's decision to halt future Falcon 9 rocket landings in the country pending an environmental review. Starship is SpaceX's new, fully reusable spacecraft and is distinct from their Falcon 9 rockets.
