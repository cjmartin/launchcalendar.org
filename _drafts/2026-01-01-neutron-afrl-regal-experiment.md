Rocket Lab has signed a contract with the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory to launch a demonstration mission using its reusable Neutron rocket no earlier than 2026. The mission, part of the AFRL's REGAL (Rocket Experimentation for Global Agile Logistics) program, aims to demonstrate point-to-point cargo transportation and re-entry capability for the DoD. The Neutron rocket and its launch site, LC-3 at MARS (Wallops, Virginia), are in advanced stages of preparation, with second stage qualification completed and first stage underway. Rocket Lab's focus on reusability and agile logistics has also paused Electron reusability efforts to prioritize Neutron development. Details on the specific payloads remain undisclosed.
