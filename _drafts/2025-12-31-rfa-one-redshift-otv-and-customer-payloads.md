Rocket Factory Augsburg (RFA) targets the first vertical orbital launch from UK soil with its maiden RFA One launch from the Fredo pad at SaxaVord Spaceport, Unst, Shetland Islands, by the end of 2025. The three-stage RFA One, with a payload capacity of up to 1,300 kg to SSO, aims for a lower initial performance (~500 kg to SSO) for this debut flight. The Redshift OTV will serve as the upper stage for precise payload delivery. After overcoming a 2024 test anomaly, RFA has refined both vehicle and software for flight readiness. This launch, carrying RFA's Redshift OTV and customer payloads, is set to mark a historic milestone for the UK's space sector. The article details the SaxaVord site, infrastructure, regulatory milestones, and RFA’s industrialization approach. It includes discussion on pad development, launch licensing, RFA’s design philosophy, and preparations for future launches.
