Leidos and industry partners, under the Department of Defense MACH-TB program, completed two successful launches of reusable hypersonic test vehicles using the Stratolaunch Talon-A platform. The most recent launch, conducted in March 2025, demonstrated rapid turnaround and reusability, with the Talon-A flying at speeds above Mach 5, launched from the Roc carrier aircraft over the Pacific, and landing at Vandenberg SFB. This test campaign represents a significant milestone, marking the first national return to reusable hypersonic flight test since the X-15. The MACH-TB program aims to accelerate and democratize hypersonic testing for defense applications.
