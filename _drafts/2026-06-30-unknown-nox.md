D-Orbit is preparing to launch NOX, a sophisticated Earth observation satellite using synthetic aperture radar, as part of the ESA-led IRIDE program. The NOX spacecraft is heavily based on D-Orbit's Ion platform and is scheduled for launch in mid-2026, with the European launcher yet to be confirmed. The mission, backed by the Italian government's PNRR and MetaSensing, pushes the Ion bus to new capabilities and will provide high-resolution radar imaging over a planned five-year mission.
