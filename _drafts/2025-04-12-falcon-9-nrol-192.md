SpaceX successfully launched the NROL-192 mission for the National Reconnaissance Office from Vandenberg Space Force Base on April 12, 2025, at 12:25 UTC. The mission included a batch of Starshield satellites, a government variant of Starlink, supporting the NRO's proliferated architecture for reconnaissance and intelligence gathering. The launch marked the 400th use of a previously flown Falcon booster and the 430th landing of a first stage. NRO is ramping up its constellation with multiple launches scheduled in April 2025. The mission's payload remains classified, but the satellites are expected to enhance the agency's data collection and observation capabilities.
