The Czech Ministry of Transport has selected 14 scientific experiments for Aleš Svoboda to perform aboard the International Space Station (ISS) during a private astronaut mission managed by Axiom Space. The launch is expected around the turn of 2027/2028 and will use a SpaceX Crew Dragon. Svoboda, an ESA reserve astronaut, will focus on research ranging from immune system behavior in space to microalgae and embryonic development. The Czech project aims to foster domestic space industry innovation. Final preparations and experiment integration will continue into 2027 ahead of the mission.
