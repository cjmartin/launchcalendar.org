On April 24, 2025, SpaceX launched 28 Starlink broadband satellites aboard a Falcon 9 rocket from Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The mission, Starlink 6-74, marked SpaceX's 47th Falcon 9 launch and 30th Starlink mission of 2025. The booster, B1069, completed its 23rd flight and landed successfully on the droneship 'A Shortfall of Gravitas'. The Starlink satellites were deployed to low Earth orbit and will soon join the existing megaconstellation, now comprising over 7,000 satellites.
