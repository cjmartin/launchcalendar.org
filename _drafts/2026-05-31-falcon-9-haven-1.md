Vast is on track to launch Haven-1, its first commercial space station module, on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket no earlier than May 2026, following the completion and testing of the flight structure. Manufacturing is scheduled to complete by July 2025, followed by integration and environmental testing at NASAâ€™s Glenn Research Center. Haven-1 is designed to host up to four crew members for science-focused missions of about two weeks. Partnerships with SpaceX and other industry players support development and future operations. Crew selection for the first mission is forthcoming. The launch marks a key milestone in commercial orbital habitats, aiming to succeed the International Space Station.
