Dr. Marta Ewa Wachowicz has been appointed as the new President of the Polish Space Agency (POLSA) after her predecessor's abrupt departure, prompted by political controversy over a Falcon 9 debris incident and a cybersecurity breach. One of her first tasks is to oversee Poland's inaugural mission to the International Space Station, set for 29 May 2025. ESA astronaut reserve Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski will participate in this mission aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon as part of a private Axiom Space flight. This marks a significant milestone in Poland's engagement with human spaceflight.
