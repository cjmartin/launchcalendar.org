  SpaceX's Falcon 9 launched the NROL-145 classified payload—a mission for the
  U.S. National Reconnaissance Office, likely involving a batch of advanced
  Starshield reconnaissance satellites—on April 20, 2025, from SLC-4E at
  Vandenberg Space Force Base, California. This launch was part of the NRO's
  'proliferated architecture' program, believed to be constructing a network of
  many small, cost-effective spy satellites, possibly modified Starlink craft.
  As is typical for NRO launches, specific payload details remain classified.

On April 20, 2025, SpaceX launched the 10th batch of 'proliferated architecture' spy satellites for the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), with the mission named NROL-145. The Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from SLC-4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, at 8:29 a.m. EDT. The mission is believed to have deployed a network of Starshield reconnaissance satellites, part of the NRO's new paradigm utilizing many small, advanced satellites, some possibly based on modified Starlink technology. Specific payload and mission details remain classified. Falcon 9 booster B1082, on its 12th flight, successfully landed on the droneship Of Course I Still Love You. The webcast concluded after booster landing at the request of the NRO, and no further information was released. This marked the NRO's 10th proliferated architecture launch, SpaceX's 44th Falcon 9 mission of the year, and the first of three Falcon 9 launches within a 37-hour period from different launch pads.
