On April 20, 2025, SpaceX's Falcon 9 launched the NROL-145 mission from SLC-4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base for the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office. The classified payload is believed to be a new network of Starshield reconnaissance satellites, marking the NRO's 10th flight in support of their 'proliferated architecture'. Booster B1082, on its 12th flight, successfully landed on the droneship Of Course I Still Love You. This marked SpaceX's 44th Falcon 9 mission of the year and was the first of three Falcon 9 launches in less than 37 hours from different pads.
