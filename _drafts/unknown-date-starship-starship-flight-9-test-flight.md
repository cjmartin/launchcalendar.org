SpaceX is preparing a fleet of Starship vehicles for future launches out of Starbase, Texas. Ship 35 recently completed static fire testing, though a non-nominal shutdown was reported during the six-engine static fire. Flight 9, pairing Ship 35 with the previously-flown Booster 14, was initially tentatively targeted for May 9/10, but that window appears to have slipped following further testing requirements. This mission will mark the first reflight of a Super Heavy booster. Other vehicles, like Ship 36, Ship 37, Ship 38, and Ship 39, as well as Boosters 15, 16, and 17, are in various stages of assembly, testing, and refurbishment as SpaceX builds up launch cadence and incorporates design changes informed by previous test flights.
