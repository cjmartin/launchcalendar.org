NASA's SPHEREx team celebrated the successful launch of the SPHEREx astrophysics observatory by ringing the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange on April 22, 2025. SPHEREx was launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base on March 12, 2025. Now in sun-synchronous, low Earth orbit, SPHEREx will collect data on over 450 million galaxies and 100 million stars, advancing scientists' understanding of the universe's evolution and the search for key ingredients for life.
