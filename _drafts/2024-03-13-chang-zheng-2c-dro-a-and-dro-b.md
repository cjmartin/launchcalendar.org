On March 13, 2024, a Chang Zheng 2C rocket launched the DRO-A and DRO-B satellites from Xichang as part of China's effort to create the world's first constellation of satellites in a distant retrograde orbit (DRO) around the Moon. An early anomaly left the satellites stranded in LEO, but engineers skillfully recovered them, enabling a successful lunar capture using minimal fuel. A third satellite, DRO-L, launched separately in February 2024 into Sun-synchronous orbit, now completes the trio, forming a cislunar navigation and communication network for future lunar activity support.
