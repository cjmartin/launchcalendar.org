China is set to launch its Shenzhou 20 mission, the ninth crewed flight to the Tiangong space station, on April 24, 2025 at 09:17 UTC from Site 901 at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. Three taikonauts—Chen Dong (commander), Chen Zhongrui (mission operator), and Wang Jie (science operator)—will spend six months aboard Tiangong, conducting EVAs and science experiments before returning in October. This mission coincides with the 55th anniversary of Dongfanghong-1 and China's 10th Space Day. The launch will be performed by the Chang Zheng 2F/G Y20 rocket, which recently received upgrades to its capsule interior, increasing payload capacity by 20%. The crew will relieve the Shenzhou 19 team and continue Tiangong's streak of continuous human habitation.
