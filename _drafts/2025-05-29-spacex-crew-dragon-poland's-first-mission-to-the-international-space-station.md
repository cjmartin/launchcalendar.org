Dr. Marta Ewa Wachowicz was appointed as the new President of the Polish Space Agency following a leadership change prompted by political controversy over a Falcon 9 debris incident and a cybersecurity breach. One of her first tasks is to oversee Poland's first mission to the International Space Station, scheduled for 29 May 2025. This mission, managed by Axiom Space, will see ESA astronaut reserve Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski launch aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon for a private mission to the ISS.
