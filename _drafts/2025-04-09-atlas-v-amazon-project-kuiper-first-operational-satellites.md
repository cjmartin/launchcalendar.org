The United Launch Alliance Atlas V was scheduled to launch Amazon's first batch of Project Kuiper operational satellites from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, on April 9, 2025. The launch was postponed due to bad weather. These are the first operational satellites of more than 3,200 planned for Kuiper, Amazon's new Internet megaconstellation and the first major US competitor to SpaceX's Starlink.
