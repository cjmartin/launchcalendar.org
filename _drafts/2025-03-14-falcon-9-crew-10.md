In March 2025, SpaceX successfully launched the Crew-10 mission from LC-39A at Kennedy Space Center, sending NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, JAXA astronaut Takuya Onishi, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Kirill Peskov to the International Space Station (ISS). The mission used Crew Dragon Endurance and marked a smooth continuation of the commercial crew program. This mission also paved the way for the return of Crew-9 and transitioned SpaceX's Dragon recovery operations to the Pacific Ocean.
