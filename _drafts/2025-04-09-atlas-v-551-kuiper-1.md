The United Launch Alliance (ULA) was forced to scrub the scheduled launch of its Atlas V 551 rocket carrying the Kuiper 1 mission for Amazon's Project Kuiper due to poor weather, specifically offshore thunderstorms. This marked the first launch attempt for the full production batch of Project Kuiper satellites, aiming to deploy 27 broadband satellites to low Earth orbit. The mission, critical to Amazon's satellite internet ambitions, will be rescheduled once a new date is determined. The article also discusses the broader Kuiper constellation plans and ULA's remaining Atlas V and Vulcan launch manifest for Amazon and other customers.
