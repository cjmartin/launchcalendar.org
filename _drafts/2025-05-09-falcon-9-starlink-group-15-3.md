SpaceX's launch of Starlink Group 15-3, carrying 26 smallsats, has experienced multiple delays due to unfavorable weather, including 100% cloud cover and high winds. Originally scheduled for May 3, then moved to May 4, it is now tentatively set for Friday, May 9 at Vandenberg Space Force Base, with a launch window from 5:00 PM to 9:00 PM PDT. A static fire test was conducted successfully, and the Falcon 9 first stage is aiming for a droneship landing after launch. The mission will further expand the Starlink constellation in low Earth orbit.
