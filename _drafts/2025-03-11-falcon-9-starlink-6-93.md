SpaceX is preparing its 470th Falcon 9 launch, carrying 28 Starlink V2 Mini satellites as part of the Starlink 6-93 mission. The launch is scheduled from SLC-40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, with a four-hour window and an 85% chance of favorable weather. Booster B1085 will be used for the seventh time, aiming for landing on the droneship 'Just Read the Instructions'. The mission will add to the constellation of more than 7,300 Starlink satellites currently in orbit.
