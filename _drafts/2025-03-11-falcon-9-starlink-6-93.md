SpaceX is set to launch the Starlink 6-93 mission, sending 28 Starlink V2 Mini satellites to low Earth orbit atop a Falcon 9 rocket from SLC-40, Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. This will be the 470th Falcon 9 launch and will add to SpaceX's rapidly growing Starlink broadband constellation. The launch window opens Tuesday night, with an 85% chance of favorable weather forecast. The Falcon 9 first stage booster (B1085) will attempt its seventh flight and target a landing on the droneship 'Just Read the Instructions' (JRTI). Live coverage is provided by Spaceflight Now.
