SES announced that its O3b mPOWER constellation's capacity will grow by 30% in 2025, enabled by the seventh and eighth O3b mPOWER satellites, which launched in December last year (2024) and are entering service soon. These new satellites feature redesigned payload power modules to address issues found in earlier units. The increased capacity is already in demand, particularly from government, maritime, and aeronautical customers. SES expects to sell out the new capacity quickly.
