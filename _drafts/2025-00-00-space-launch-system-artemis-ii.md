NASA teams at Kennedy Space Center recently removed one RS-25 engine from the Artemis II Space Launch System rocket, due to a hydraulic leak, and replaced it with another engine. Artemis II is slated to launch four astronauts on a mission around the Moon next year. Integration and securing of the replacement engine in the core stage is currently in progress.
