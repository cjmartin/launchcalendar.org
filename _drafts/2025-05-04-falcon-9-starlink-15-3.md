SpaceX is targeting Sunday, May 4 at 10:59 a.m. PDT (17:59 UTC) for the launch of 26 Starlink V2 Mini satellites, known as the Starlink 15-3 mission, aboard a Falcon 9 rocket from SLC-4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base. The launch was scrubbed on Saturday but is now rescheduled. Booster 1081, which has previously flown several missions including Crew-7 and CRS-29, will support the launch and attempt recovery on the droneship 'Of Course I Still Love You.' This mission reflects SpaceX's growing launch cadence from this West Coast pad, supported by recent FAA approval allowing for increased launch frequency.
