Leidos and its industry team conducted the first in a series of fully recoverable, uncrewed hypersonic test vehicle flights for the MACH-TB program, using the Stratolaunch Talon-A. Launched over the Pacific from the ROC carrier aircraft, the test established the MACH-TB framework for accelerating hypersonic testing and vehicle turnaround. The campaign marks the nation's return to reusable hypersonic flight tests.
