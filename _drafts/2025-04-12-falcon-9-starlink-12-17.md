SpaceX successfully launched the Starlink 12-17 mission from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39A at 8:53 p.m. EDT on Saturday (12:53 UTC), after weather-related scrubs. The launch marked SpaceX's 400th flight with a previously flown booster, B1083, which completed its 10th mission. The payload consisted of 21 Starlink V2 Mini satellites, 13 of which feature Direct to Cell capabilities. The booster landed on the droneship 'A Shortfall of Gravitas', achieving its 104th landing. SpaceX continues to expand Starlink's global service reach, including new markets in Japan, Guyana, and Jordan.
