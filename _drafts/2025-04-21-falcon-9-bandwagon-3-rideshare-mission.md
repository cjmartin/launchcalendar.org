On April 21, 2025, SpaceX's Falcon 9 launched from SLC-40 with its third Bandwagon small satellite rideshare mission. Payloads included Atmos Space Cargo's Phoenix-1 prototype reentry capsule, Tomorrow.io weather satellites, and a HawkEye 360 Earth observation cluster, among others. The mission demonstrates the Bandwagon program's focus on mid-inclination LEO orbits and flexible payload capabilities, including innovative technologies for atmospheric reentry and multiple customer demos. Booster B1090, in its third flight, successfully returned to land at LZ-2.
