  SpaceX launched the Bandwagon-3 rideshare mission with the Phoenix 1 European
  reentry capsule and multiple satellites from Cape Canaveral Space Force
  Station, Florida. The mission included several significant payloads such as
  the South Korean 425Sat-3 government satellite, a European reentry capsule
  (Phoenix-1) developed by Atmos Space Cargo to test inflatable heat shield
  technology, a weather satellite for Tomorrow Companies Inc. (Tomorrow-S7), and
  the HawkEye 360 Earth observation cluster. Bandwagon-3 highlights SpaceX's
  expanding rideshare program, offering flexible payload capabilities,
  mid-inclination LEO services, and flights for both governmental and commercial
  customers. The mission also featured the successful use of Falcon 9 booster
  B1090 for the third time, returning to LZ-2. Notably, it marked the first
  European mission to test the Phoenix-1 reentry capsule's inflatable
  technology.

On April 21, 2025, SpaceX launched the Bandwagon-3 rideshare mission using a Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. The mission's highlight was Phoenix 1, a reentry capsule developed by Germany's Atmos Space Cargo—the first such European mission to test inflatable heat shield technology. In addition to Phoenix 1, the mission included 425Sat-3 for South Korea's Agency for Defense Development, Tomorrow-S7, a weather satellite for Tomorrow Companies Inc., and a HawkEye 360 Earth observation cluster. Bandwagon-3 is part of SpaceX's growing series of rideshare launches enabling varied private and governmental missions, and further demonstrated the Bandwagon program’s focus on flexible, mid-inclination LEO rideshares. Falcon 9 booster B1090 flew for the third time during this mission, returning again to LZ-2.
