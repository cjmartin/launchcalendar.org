Kosmos 482, a Soviet Venus lander launched in 1972 as part of the Venera program, failed to leave Earth orbit due to issues with its Molniya-M rocket. For more than 50 years, it has slowly descended in an elliptical Earth orbit, and is predicted to reenter the atmosphere on or about May 10, 2025. Because it was built to survive Venusian entry, Kosmos 482 may survive reentry relatively intact, unlike most spacecraft, which tend to burn up. Similar recent reentries included Chinese and SpaceX satellites, but Kosmos 482's potential splashdown or impact is being closely watched, especially as it may create a unique skywatching spectacle. The probe weighs about 495 kg. Additional context and updates are available in related articles.
