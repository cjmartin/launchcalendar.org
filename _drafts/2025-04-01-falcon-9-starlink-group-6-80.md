The start of April 2025 saw a Falcon 9 launch the first batch of 28 Starlink v2 Mini satellites. These satellites are 23% lighter and provide nearly 2.7 Tbps of fronthaul capacity per launch, representing a significant step up in Starlink's deployment and service capability. This mission exemplifies SpaceX's continued improvements and increasing cadence in their Starlink constellation flights.
