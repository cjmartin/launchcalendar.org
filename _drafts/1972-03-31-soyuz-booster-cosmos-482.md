Cosmos 482, launched in March 1972 by the Soviet Union as a Venus lander, failed to leave Earth orbit due to a premature cutoff of the Soyuz booster's upper stage. The probe has remained stranded in orbit for 53 years. According to satellite watcher Marco Langbroek, the landing module is expected to make an uncontrolled reentry to Earth around May 9-10, 2025. The lander was designed to endure Venus' harsh atmospheric entry, raising questions about its survivability through Earth's reentry. The remaining module has a mass of just under 500 kg and is not considered a significant threat, though its reentry is being carefully monitored.
