On April 21, 2025 at 8:48 p.m. EDT (April 22, 0048 UTC), SpaceX launched the Bandwagon-3 rideshare mission from SLC-40, Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, marking the 300th orbital flight from the pad. The Falcon 9 carried a diverse set of payloads: the fourth synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite for South Korea's Korea 425 Project military constellation, Tomorrow.io's Tomorrow-S7 weather monitoring satellite, and Atmos Space Cargo’s Phoenix 1 re-entry capsule. The Korea 425 satellite is part of a series of five military surveillance satellites. The Phoenix 1 capsule, the first of its kind from a private European company, aims to collect heat shield flight data by deorbiting after two orbits. The booster B1090 successfully landed at Landing Zone 2 shortly after liftoff. The flight is the third Bandwagon rideshare to mid-inclination orbits and highlights significant advancements for both satellite and re-entry technology.
