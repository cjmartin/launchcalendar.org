China launched the Shenzhou 20 mission to the Tiangong space station on April 24, 2025, at 5:17 a.m. EDT (0917 GMT) from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. The mission carried three astronauts: commander Chen Dong (on his third spaceflight), Chen Zhongrui, and Wang Jie, both on their first missions. Shenzhou 20 is expected to dock with Tiangong about 6.5 hours after launch, where the crew will begin a six-month stay, marking the ninth crewed trip to Tiangong and the sixth since its completion in 2022. The article provides background on the astronauts, details their mission objectives, and mentions the upcoming Tianzhou 9 cargo launch during their stay. The mission is part of the planned long-term occupation and expansion of Chinaâ€™s Tiangong space station, with China also collaborating with Pakistan to eventually send a foreign astronaut to the station.
