On its seventh flight, Starship debuted significant Block 2 upgrades, aiming to test Starlink satellite deployment, in-space Raptor relights, and innovative reentry hardware. The flight ended with the loss of Ship 33 due to failures in the fuel distribution system that led to leaks and engine failure about eight minutes into flight.
