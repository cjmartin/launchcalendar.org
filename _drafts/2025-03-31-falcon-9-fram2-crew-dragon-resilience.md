The Fram2 mission marked the first time humans orbited Earth’s poles, launching on March 31, 2025, atop a Falcon 9 rocket from Kennedy Space Center’s LC-39A. Aboard Crew Dragon Resilience, the international four-person crew—Chun Wang, Jannicke Mikkelsen, Rabea Rogge, and Eric Philips—conducted Earth observations, studies on space adaptation sickness, and tested Starlink's laser-based Plaser communications system. They experienced unique perspectives of the polar regions and conducted the first Crew Dragon splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. The mission included scientific experiments, such as independent egress after landing and auroral studies, as well as public engagement with regular social media updates and a video interview with the crew. The article highlights experiential differences in polar orbit and insights into future orbital expeditions.
