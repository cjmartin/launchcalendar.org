SpaceX is preparing for Flight 9 of Starship with Ship 35 and Booster 14 at Starbase, Texas. Ship 35 has completed cryogenic and engine testing, though its six-engine static fire encountered issues with a Raptor Vacuum Engine shutdown. Originally targeting a May 9/10, 2025 launch window, the timeline is now uncertain due to post-test analysis and processing. This flight marks the first reuse of a Super Heavy Booster (Booster 14) for Starship. Several more Starships and boosters are in various stages of assembly and testing for subsequent flights.
