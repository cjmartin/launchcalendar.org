Starfish Space will launch its Otter Pup 2 spacecraft on the SpaceX Falcon 9 Transporter-14 rideshare mission, currently scheduled for no earlier than June 1, 2025. The aim is to complete the first commercial docking with an unprepared satellite, targeting a D-Orbit ION spacecraft in 510 km sun-synchronous orbit. This mission follows the failed docking of Otter Pup 1 due to thruster issues; Otter Pup 2 uses upgraded ThrustMe electric thrusters and new docking mechanisms. The demonstration will test Starfish's Nautilus capture system using electrostatic and electromagnetic end effectors, as well as advanced autonomous guidance and navigation software. Success would mark a key milestone in making satellite servicing scalable and affordable. The launch is notable as a technological demonstration of on-orbit servicing capabilities, with several additional Otter missions planned for the coming years.
