  Otter Pup 2 is a 40 kg satellite servicing vehicle developed by Starfish Space
  to demonstrate the first commercial docking with an unprepared D-Orbit ION
  satellite in low Earth orbit. The mission will validate satellite rendezvous,
  autonomous proximity operations, and docking using new electrostatic and
  electromagnetic capture mechanisms, along with upgraded navigation and
  propulsion systems after lessons learned from Otter Pup 1.

Starfish Space will launch its Otter Pup 2 spacecraft aboard the SpaceX Falcon 9 Transporter-14 rideshare mission, scheduled no earlier than June 1, 2025. Otter Pup 2 aims to complete the first commercial docking with an unprepared D-Orbit ION satellite in sun-synchronous orbit, testing new electrostatic and electromagnetic capture mechanisms, the advanced CETACEAN autonomous navigation system, and upgraded propulsion. This mission follows the initial Otter Pup 1 attempt and represents a pivotal step toward scalable, affordable on-orbit satellite servicing, maintenance, and refueling.
