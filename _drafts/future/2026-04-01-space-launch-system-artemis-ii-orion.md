Preparations for NASA's Artemis II mission are proceeding at Kennedy Space Center, with stacking completed for the SLS Block 1 rocket in preparation for the first crewed lunar flyby since 1972. The launch is scheduled for April 2026, with a possible move-up to February if no major issues arise. Recent stacking milestones included solid rocket booster integration, core stage stacking and a unique in-place RS-25 engine replacement. The Orion crew capsule is undergoing final preparations, including propellant loading and launch abort system installation, targeting stacking atop the SLS in fall 2025. The mission will carry four astronauts—Jeremy Hansen, Victor Glover, Reid Wiseman, and Christina Koch—and includes new CubeSat payloads, such as the South Korean K-Rad Cube. Budget uncertainties threaten the SLS and Orion programs after Artemis III. The full article details technical updates, timeline, programmatic risks, and recent policy developments impacting the Artemis program.
