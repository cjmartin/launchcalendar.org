Blue Origin's second launch of the powerful New Glenn rocket is now scheduled for no earlier than August 15, 2025, a delay from earlier plans for a late spring flight. The mission will feature the booster 'Never Tell Me The Odds' (Tail 2), with a key objective being to land and recover the reusable first stage, something that was not achieved on the first flight. The company has not yet announced the payload, and it could potentially be a mass simulator if no customer payload is secured in time. The launch will take place from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.
