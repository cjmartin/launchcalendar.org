Rocket Lab and the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) have contracted the first Neutron launch and reentry mission for no earlier than 2026 to support the Rocket Experimentation for Global Agile Logistics (REGAL) initiative. The mission will test Neutron’s reentry and landing capabilities and explore rapid, point-to-point cargo transport possibilities for military logistics. The contract demonstrates growing confidence in Neutron as a national security asset, relying on its partially reusable architecture. The Neutron debut is targeted for late 2025, with this AFRL mission to follow soon after. Rocket Lab also recently showcased video of Neutron upper-stage testing and revealed plans for a sea landing platform called 'Return on Investment.'
