Starfish Space will attempt the first commercial satellite docking in low Earth orbit with its Otter Pup 2 vehicle, launching in June 2025 aboard SpaceX's Transporter-14 rideshare mission. Otter Pup 2 will target an ION spacecraft from Italian company D-Orbit, demonstrating software-driven, small-scale satellite servicing. This mission builds upon Starfish Space's earlier experience with Otter Pup 1 and aims to showcase the feasibility of in-space inspection, orbital relocation, refueling, and repairs using compact vehicles. Success would be a significant milestone in commercial satellite servicing.
