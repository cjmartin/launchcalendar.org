Vast is moving forward rapidly with its Haven-1 commercial space station project, aiming for a May 2026 launch date on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The Haven-1 primary structure and qualification article are completed, with flight version manufacturing underway and scheduled for completion in July 2025. Following integration, checkout, and environmental testing at NASAâ€™s Glenn Research Center's Neil Armstrong Test Facility, the module will be prepared for pre-launch operations. Haven-1 is designed to accommodate up to four crew members for two-week missions and to serve as the first commercial space station in orbit. Crew selection is pending, with the goal of welcoming an initial crew in mid to late 2026. The mission involves partnerships with SpaceX and multiple industry and research partners for scientific utilization aboard Haven-1.
