Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost Mission 2, scheduled for 2026, will launch aboard the new Elytra vehicle and deliver several international payloads—including UAE’s Rashid 2 Rover, ESA’s Lunar Pathfinder, NASA’s LuSEE-Night radio telescope and User Terminal, and Australia's Fleet Space SPIDER seismic payload—to the far side of the Moon. The Blue Ghost lander will be deployed in lunar orbit, land on the surface, and deploy these payloads. Meanwhile, Elytra will remain in orbit to provide communications relay. The mission is a collaboration with multiple agencies as part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative and aims to advance lunar mobility, communications, and scientific research. Firefly completed the first commercial Moon landing in March 2025 with its previous mission.
