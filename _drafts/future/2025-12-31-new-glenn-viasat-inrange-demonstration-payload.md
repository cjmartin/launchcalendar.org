Viasat has selected Blue Origin and the New Glenn rocket to launch a demonstration of its InRange launch telemetry relay service as part of NASA’s Communications Services Project (CSP). The upcoming first mission, anticipated to fly in 2025, will integrate Viasat’s terminal and InRange solution on New Glenn for an in-flight test. This effort aims to showcase commercial SATCOM alternatives to NASA's legacy TDRS system, enabling real-time launch telemetry beyond line-of-sight. The demonstration is part of broader NASA efforts to modernize orbital communications with commercial solutions, with a full service demonstration planned for 2026.
