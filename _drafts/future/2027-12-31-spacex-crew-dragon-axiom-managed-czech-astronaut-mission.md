The Czech Ministry of Transport has selected 14 experiments for Aleš Svoboda to conduct during an Axiom-managed mission to the International Space Station, expected around late 2027 or early 2028. The mission, part of the Czech Journey to Space initiative, was secured after an agreement with Axiom Space in September 2024. Experiments will cover topics such as immune system behavior, magnetic microrobots, extremophilic microalgae, cognitive performance, spring barley, and embryonic development in space. ESA is set to finalize experiment contracts and oversee implementation. Svoboda, an ESA reserve astronaut, will carry 14 Czech science experiments as the project aims to foster domestic space industry innovation. Final preparations and experiment integration will continue into 2027 ahead of the mission, marking a significant moment for Czechia's space ambitions.
