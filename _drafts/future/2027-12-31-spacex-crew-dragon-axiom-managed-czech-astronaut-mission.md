  Czech astronaut Aleš Svoboda and a suite of 14 selected Czech experiments will
  be launched to the International Space Station as part of a private astronaut
  mission managed by Axiom Space. The experiments focus on a wide range of
  scientific topics, including immune system behavior, microgravity effects on
  organisms, cognitive performance, and biotechnologies. The project is notable
  for its significance to Czechia’s growing space ambitions.

The Czech Ministry of Transport has selected 14 experiments for Aleš Svoboda to conduct during an Axiom-managed mission to the International Space Station, planned for no earlier than late 2027 or the turn of 2027/2028. The mission, part of the Czech Journey to Space initiative, was secured after an agreement with Axiom Space in September 2024. Experiments address diverse topics like immune system behavior, magnetic microrobots, extremophilic microalgae, cognitive performance, spring barley, and embryonic development in space. ESA is set to finalize experiment contracts and oversee implementation. Final preparations and experiment integration will continue into 2027 ahead of the mission, marking a significant milestone for Czechia's space ambitions.
