On April 14, 2025, at 12 a.m. EDT (0400 UTC), SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 rocket from SLC-40 at Cape Canaveral carrying 27 Starlink V2 Mini satellites to low Earth orbit on mission Starlink 6-73. This flight used booster B1067, marking its 27th flightâ€”a new record for an orbital-class rocket. After liftoff, the first stage landed successfully on the droneship 'Just Read the Instructions,' marking its 115th recovery on that platform and the 431st ever booster landing for SpaceX. Weather conditions were highly favorable, and the launch marked the 460th overall Falcon 9 flight.
