United Launch Alliance (ULA) was set to launch Amazon's first operational Project Kuiper broadband satellites, known as KA-01, aboard an Atlas V 551 rocket from SLC-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The mission, initially scheduled for April 9, 2025, was scrubbed due to weather and rescheduled for April 14, 2025. The KA-01 launch will deploy 27 Kuiper satellites into 450 km orbit at 51.9-degree inclination. Project Kuiper aims to compete with SpaceX's Starlink and plans to ultimately deploy over 3,200 satellites. The article describes vehicle configuration, mission details, delays, and future plans for further Kuiper launches on Atlas V, Vulcan, Ariane 6, New Glenn, and Falcon 9. KA-01 is the heaviest payload ever flown by Atlas V and marks the first ULA launch of 2025.
